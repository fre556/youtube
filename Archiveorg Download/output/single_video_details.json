                "reviewbody": "This movie is fantastic.  In that late 60's battle between the perky girls and the downer of the Vietnam War, this film certainly falls on the side of the former.  This film advertises a line of refrigerators that come in 5 unique finishes - aged bronze metal, futuristic black plastic, and several natural fibers.  Wow - try cleaning those.  To make them even \"zanier\" you have the ability to cover the front panels in your own fabric, which they recommend when you want you outfit to match your appliances.  This is truly inspired....with 30 years between it, we seem serious now.",

                "reviewbody": "This is one of the most surreal movies I have seen in a long while. Produced by Jam Handy for the lovely folks at the Westinghouse corporation, this narration-free movie (save for five words spoken at the very end) features happenin' hipsters and happenin' groovy fashions---all in the service of selling appliances.\n\nEverything about this movie is over the top. The opening sequence begins with moody music and a fashionably dressed (and fashionably depressed) woman wandering through the woods. It initially appears that this movie is advocating the use of antidepressants.\n\nHowever, the movie is in actuality an advertisement for Westinghouse refrigerators and the custom paneling that covers these appliances. After showing a few of the standard custom panels (with various artificial woods, metals, and such), \"Match Your Mood\" takes a seriously wrong turn, showing a woman who simultaneously applies custom paneling to a refrigerator while dancing to psychedelic music. Many other psychedelic/mod custom panels and fashions are then shown; this all culminates in an overly groovy party featuring attractive and fashionable white people dancing around a refrigerator. Throughout are many of the wallpaper and fabric patterns of the era. This has got to be seen to be believed!",

We're being introduced to the new Westinghouse refrigerators, the cooler that likes to play dress up! I wish they still made these, I'm dying to make my kitchen over in paisley, or to match whatever clothes I'm wearing to a party. \n\nGreat film technique in a very strange subject.",

Both are loopy dance-filled salutes to refrigerators (I'm laughing as I type this as it all sounds so stupid). This film starts out very 60's, as a nicole-kidman-something-stupid-like model wanders the forest poking at stuff with a stick, it then seagues into the new Westinghouse promotion of 'Match Your Mood'. You can choose from many different styles! ('Astro-Glo Bronze' is interesting) and best of all, you can cover your fridge with wallpaper! This probably started the fridge-wallpapering craze that continued well into the 70's, and still continues to this day. Plenty of awful(ly great) and tacky wallpaper to 'match' your sport/mood/hobby (love the 'checkers' motif, as if someone would love checkers so much they decide to decorate their fridge with it). It also always helps if you're watusi-ing while you're wallpapering your fridge, as the lovely model does.\n Anyways, this film is... OUT THERE. Totally hysterical. This is, of course, a MUST SEE on this site!",
