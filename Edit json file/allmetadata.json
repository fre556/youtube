When launched in 1984, DART was controlled by 16 signal cabins, but now the entire system is monitored from a central control room at Connolly Station.\n\nChief inspector Brendan Barnes highlights the numerous advantages of a computer-based signaling system over the old manual system, emphasizing its enhanced safety. Signalman Tony Reynolds shares his experience transitioning from a manual signal box to the computerized system after a fourteen-week training course.\n\nGerry Hunt, another signalman, demonstrates how he ensures level crossings are clear by monitoring screens and pressing buttons on the console. He recounts various incidents and the occasional need for coordination among signalmen during crossing issues.\n\nDespite the technological advancements, Reynolds nostalgically recalls the days of manual signaling, where he could directly observe the passing trains.

He traveled to the United States, joining his brothers Paddy and Tom and performing with Tommy Makem. Their signature Aran jumpers, sent by Mrs. Clancy, became iconic as they played venues like the White Horse Tavern in New York.\n\nTheir appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1961 catapulted them to international stardom, contributing significantly to the 1960s folk revival. Bob Dylan described Liam as 'the best ballad singer I’d ever heard in my life.'\n\nLiam pursued a successful solo career and reunited with Makem for 13 years. The quartet reunited in 1984 for a documentary and tours. Settling in An Rinn, County Waterford, Liam continued performing and published his autobiography ‘The Mountain of the Women’ in 2002.

During the winter, fishing is Ardmore’s main industry.\n\nChildren from a local school sing a ballad about the history of Ardmore which mentions the town’s patron saint, Saint Declan. It is believed he came to Ardmore from Wales in the early 5th Century. Some people say his missionary work may have pre-dated the activities of Saint Patrick.\n\nOn his arrival at Ardmore, St Declan set up a monastery which became the main church in what was known as the Kingdom of Déisi Muman. This medieval monastery is known for its sculptures depicting scenes from The Bible. A round-tower was also added to the monastery in the 12th century.\n\nOn 26 August 1642, Lord Dungarvan and Lord Broghill set sail from Lismore to lay siege to the round tower and castle in Ardmore.\n\nHowever, the people of Ardmore knew they were coming and about forty of them retreated to the round tower. This event is dramatised by the schoolchildren.\n\nThe whole event ended in disaster, the people had to surrender when the enemy brought in cannon from the sea the next day, Saturday 27 of August 1642, 117 people from Ardmore were hanged.\n\nA ‘Youngline’ report broadcast on 20 December 1979.

The nearby Mullingar House also features centrally in ‘Finnegan’s Wake’ in which publican Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker resides.\n\nIn Chapelizod Frank Harte points out derelict houses where families lived when he was growing up. The village is a stone’s throw from the Phoenix Park,\n\nThe area known as The Bank and New Row, was built to house distillery workers and their families.\n\nFrank Harte’s father owned and ran ‘The Tap’ pub in the village, across the road from industrial buildings where in the seventeenth century flax and linen were processed. It then became a distillery and latterly a warehouse, before being destroyed by fire in recent years.\n\nAnother writer with Chapelizod connections is Gothic writer Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu (1814-1873). The village and environs provided inspiration for his ghost stories, horror fiction and many novels, in particular, ‘The House of the Churchyard’,\n\nIn his descriptions of it, and the house, you know he was here.\n\nJust off Main Street is Saint Laurence’s Church of Ireland with its distinctive fifteenth-century square stone tower, which incorporates a section of a round tower. The site has for centuries been associated with the medieval tale of Tristan and Isolde.\n\nIt’s from Isolde that the village got its name.\n\nThis episode of ‘The Dublin Village’ was broadcast on 15 July 1988.

Taking as a starting point the book ‘Facts About Ireland’ published by the Department of External Affairs he enlarges it’s themes and develops them further.\n\nAll of it is true but it’s not all of the truth.\n\nLike every race the Irish are the product of change, slow moving time and our environment.\n\nWe’re different from other races because the influences that shaped us are different.\n\nHe argues that political events help to form the persona of a race, but he defines politics as\n\nThe response of a people to any forces that affect their fortunes as a people.\n\nÓ Faoláin shows how these responses developed over the centuries. He believes the end of the Ice Age some 8000 years ago is the most important single political event in Ireland’s story. Becoming an island apart from the rest of Europe allowed us to develop our own distinctive way of life in virtual isolation. He wonders\n\nWhat manner of people were our earliest forbears who began to trickle in here on the Antrim coast about eight thousand years ago?\n\nSadly we know far more about the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt than we do about our first islanders.\n\n‘We The Irish: People And Place’ written and presented by Seán Ó Faoláin was broadcast on 29 September 1971.

        "Description": "An extract from a ‘Prime Time Investigates’ programme looking at the neglect of generations of economic migrants. These Irish people are forgotten by the country of their birth and often ignored by their adopted home.\n\nIn this extract Frank and Seamus, two Irish men who emigrated over thirty years ago, talk about their circumstances now living in London.\n\nSeamus and Frank walking from their house in the Cricklewood area of London. Reporter Paul Rouse explains that for years Seamus and Frank worked on building sites all across London but their generation is now replaced by migrants from Eastern Europe.\n\nA house is shown in Cricklewood, London that’s shared by eight Irishmen. Seamus’ rent of £85 per week is paid by the local council to his Irish landlord. Seamus and Frank drink cider in Seamus’ squalid bed-sit. Another Irishman called Billy talks to them from the door. Seamus has lived here for 8 years; there is now no light, heat, or running water.\n\nSeamus says there was electricity and gas but the landlady pulled the gas out. He says he is not receiving welfare. He says the lads are good to me, between that and the skips I’m surviving; they know I’ll bounce back.\n\nSeamus shows the camera a wind-up radio which he describes as his best friend. Asked about his future he says, “I’m bang on 50. I don’t really know you know? I’m living day to day, if Celtic win I’m happy, if they lose I’m depressed. That is about the size of it. I’d love to get out of this room, please God.”\n\nFrank, who is from County Longford, describes his flat consisting of a double-bed, a cooker and sink which doesn’t work, and no hot water. He says his landlady wants £95 per week. He says there was a rat here recently, but the landlady says if you get the rat catcher out you pay him. I’m not paying him, I worked all my life, paid all my taxes, now look where I’m stuck, after all my work. Says when he was mugged and fell on hard times and he had an awful struggle getting a few pounds out of this government.\n\nFrank’s room is decorated with Irish flags, maps, and trinkets.\n\n“There is a lot of paraphernalia here belonging to Ireland. I had to leave it but my heart is still there. My heart is still there that is why all the paraphernalia is up there. Why wouldn’t it? I don't know how to say it..I had to leave it but I want to die in it.”\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.

        "Description": "DUP leader Ian Paisley has announced a policy shift from integration with Britain towards the possibility of an independent Northern Ireland.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Leader Rev Ian Paisley spoke about an independent Ulster in an interview with London Weekend Television’s Weekend World programme on 27 January. He admitted that his views on an independent Northern Ireland were against everything he had stood for.

        "Description": "Exploring the history of Hook Peninsula with Wexford man Billy Colfer.\n\nWith its sandy beaches, fishing villages and beautiful scenery, the most southern part of County Wexford is scattered with Norman castles and locations where history was forged, and Ireland’s fortune changed.\n\nThe small fishing village of Ballyhack with its car ferry transporting cars and pedestrians to and from Passage East across the River Barrow, is overlooked by a fifteenth century tower house built by the Knights Hospitallers of St John, a Catholic military order later known as the Knights of Malta.\n\nThey took over the duties and lands of their rivals the Knights Templar following the order’s dissolution in 1307. The Hospitallers had two other stone towers on the Hook Peninsula at Kilcloggan and Templetown.\n\nBilly Colfer explains how the land was granted to the Knights Hospitallers by William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke. He was also Strongbow’s son in law, and the man who built the lighthouse tower at Hook Head. He brought the Knights to Ballyhack\n\nChun faire a choimead ar an ferry agus ar na bradáin freisin a bhí flúirseach in san abhainn.\n\nBaginbun headland, where Celtic tribes built a fortification known as Dún Dónaill, overlooks a beautiful sandy beach, frequented by both locals and the many visitors to this part of the sunny south east. This tranquil part of the peninsula has a dramatic and violent past.\n\nIt was here that Raymond le Gros FitzGerald landed with only a hundred or so soldiers in 1170, and changed the course of Irish history,\n\nAt the creek of Baginbun, Ireland was lost and won.\n\nCenturies later a Martello tower was constructed on the headland circa 1805, as part of the British crown’s defence against a possible invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nNearby Slade is picturesque fishing village where catches of lobster, crab and mackerel are landed. It also has a castle, built by the Anglo-Norman Laffan family in the 15th century, who made their fortune from fishing and trading.\n\nThe castle and adjacent lands passed into the hands of the Loftus family in 1666, and it was they who constructed the harbour in 1684. Ten years later salt works buildings were added, but this industry had gone into decline by the nineteenth century.\n\nThe village of Fethard-On-Sea (the latter part of the name added in the early twentieth century to differentiate it from Fethard in County Tipperary) is another place owing its existence to the Norman invasion,\n\nBhí an Fiodh Árd ar ceann don na chéad bailtigh a bhunaigh na hAngla-Normannaigh i gCondae Loch Garman.\n\nThe castle and the tower being the only mediaeval part remaining, was used mainly as a summer residence for the Bishop of Ferns, but after the Reformation became part of the Loftus family’s estate.\nThe adjacent St Mogue’s Church, dating from 1684, was rebuilt in 1837, and is the final resting place of Alexander Devereux, the last Abbot of Dunbrody Abbey.\n\nThis episode of ‘Súil Thart’ was broadcast on 7 October 1989.

        "Title": "Restoring Limerick's Historic Potato Market, 1987",
        "Description": "The old Potato Market has been restored and is being given a new lease of life thanks to the Limerick Civic Trust.\n\nLimerick got its first charter as a city in 1137, then the medieval settlement of Englishtown. On one corner of King’s Island is the site known as the Potato Market, which is reportedly the original site of the city of Limerick when it was founded by the Danes in 922.\n\nThe Potato Market is the latest jewel in the crown of the Limerick Civic Trust.\n\nThe Limerick Civic Trust is a voluntary body set up in 1983 with the objective of restoring and preserving the ancient and historic sites of Limerick.\n\nA new pedestrian bridge, the ‘Sylvester O’Halloran Bridge’ has been built to link the Potato Market with the Custom House Quay. The bridge is named after a Limerick-born surgeon who pioneered cataract surgery.\n\nDenis Leonard of the Limerick Civic Trust talks about the tradition of markets in Limerick and the work involved in restoring the market over a period of three years at a cost of almost £400,000. The newly restored market is intended for both locals and tourists.\n\nIt was a huge job. It was very derelict.\n\nThe Potato Market was originally opened in 1843 but fell into disrepair and disuse in the early 20th century. The restoration work was carried out by skilled craftsmen and AnCO trainees.\n\nJohn Cosgrove remembers selling potatoes at the original market in 1925 and is delighted to see the new development. There are now plans to broaden the activities that take place at the Potato Market including hosting music festivals and open-air theatre.\n\nThis episode of ‘Evening Extra’ was broadcast on 7 December 1987. The reporter is Shay Healy.\n\n‘Evening Extra’ was a nightly magazine programme which ran from Monday to Friday at 7 pm dealing with current issues and people in the news. The first episode was aired on Monday 13 October 1986 and it ran for 278 shows over 2 years until the final show on 29 April 1988. The programme had numerous presenters and reporters including Siobhan Cleary, Richard Crowley, Bibi Baskin, Aonghus McAnally and Shay Healy.\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.

        "Description": "The long wait ends for Limerick who are All Ireland Hurling Champions.\n\nIn pouring rain at Croke Park Limerick won the Liam McCarthy Cup for the first time since 1940. Perhaps the weather kept many away as the attendance of 58,009 was the lowest for an All Ireland Hurling Final in twenty-five years. The rain could not dampen the joyous scenes as Limerick supporters and players celebrated at the final whistle.\n\nLimerick made the better start but when Pat Delaney scored a goal for Kilkenny after twenty minutes it put the Cats ahead by a point 1-03 to 0-05. Limerick regathered and pressure on the Kilkenny defence resulted in frees which Richie Bennis converted. By half-time, Limerick had the lead back again 0-12 to 1-07.\n\nWithin five minutes of the restart, the sides were level again. Then Frank Cummins went on a run sending a ball into Mick Crotty who looked like he must score a goal but Limerick goalkeeper Seamus Horgan made a remarkable save to deflect it over the bar. Kilkenny lead by one point 1-10 to 0-12. Shortly afterwards another Richie Bennis free levelled the game again.\n\nLimerick attacked again and when Noel Skehan could only partially block a shot from Moss Dowling, the ball was bundled into the net after a goalmouth scramble. Bernie Hartigan added another point. Suddenly Limerick were four ahead 1-14 to 1-10. Although Kilkenny managed to close the gap to two points, Limerick were always able to keep their opponents at bay to secure victory.\n\nIn remarkable scenes of celebration, joyous Limerick supporters invaded the pitch. Captain Éamonn Grimes accepted the Liam McCarthy Cup as Limerick were crowned All Ireland Champions for the first time in thirty-three years.\n\nThe final score was Limerick 1-21 Kilkenny 1-14.\n\nThe All Ireland Hurling Final was broadcast live on 2 September 1973.

        "Description": "Although many streets in Wexford were renamed after participants in the Easter Rising, local people continue to refer to the original names.\n\nFollowing a plebiscite in 1932, Wexford Council changed the town’s street names to honour those who took part in the Easter Rising of 1916. However, locals still use the original street names and are often unaware of the new ones.\n\nFrank Hall visits Wexford to investigate whether its citizens are familiar with the official street names or if they are still using the old names. He asks a number of people for directions and discovers that many of them are unfamiliar with James Connolly Street but can all point him in the direction of William Street.\n\nA guide for the Old Wexford Society Sammy Coe explains the meaning behind the name Keyser Lane, the second oldest street in Wexford and the only one to escape renaming. He agrees the dual naming is confusing for tourists to Wexford. The street plates have new names but the old names are still in the guide books and maps of the town.\n\nI’m sure the Rising generation will eventually come around to the new name.\n\nSome of the new names have caught on however, and Pearse Street is no longer referred to as Talbot Street. Wexford Corporation solely uses the new names in all official correspondence and fortunately for all, the Post Office is familiar with both versions.\n\nThis episode of ‘Hall’s Pictorial Weekly’ was broadcast on 20 October 1971.

        "Description": "Colin and Marjorie Johnston have built a roundhouse and are looking to have a self-sufficient life in the Burren in County Clare.\n\nColin and Marjorie Johnston are part of the back-to-the-land movement that grew out of alternative ways of looking at society and lifestyles.\n\nHaving been given the use of what was previously scrub land, the couple went about clearing the ground and building a home for themselves and their animals.\n\nColin from Belfast and Marjorie from Portsmouth gave up city living to strive for rural self-sufficiency. Marjorie had always fantasised about living this kind of life but never believed that it could come true. The dream has become a reality having now lived their alternative lifestyle for the last seven years.\n\nThey have built a house without the use of any machinery using upcycled local stone and reeds for the roof.\n\nAccording to Colin,\n\nWe both felt very much that we wanted to live in a round house. We both looked at various round structures.\n\nMarjorie adds,\n\nWe also wanted something that would fit into the landscape I think, which I believe this does.\n\nThe house is based on the traditions of the type of housing in neolithic times when the building of roundhouses with thatched conical roofs was commonplace.\n\nThe process of construction may have been quite slow and hard on the hands but ultimately they found it very rewarding.\n\nThe Johnstons have also cultivated a vegetable garden, an orchard, and a herb garden. Marjorie is experimenting with using plants to dye wool and also for medicinal purposes.\n\nThis episode of ‘Access’ was broadcast on 10 January 1985.

Christ Church was founded by the Norsemen in 1038 when King Sigtrygg gave Bishop Dúnán the hill of Dublin as a site for a cathedral.\n\nThe Very Rev Tom Salmon Dean of Christ Church describes the early days of Christ Church Cathedral as a simple, wooden structure. When the Normans arrived with their gift for building, Strongbow and St Laurence O’Toole began to rebuild the cathedral into the building that we know today. There have been several restorations over the years but the building remains exactly as Strongbow and St Laurence planned it.\n\nCanon AE Stokes Member of the Board describes how in Elizabethan times in 1562, the main fabric of the building almost collapsed completely. The Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney carried out repairs which remained until Victorian times when the cathedral was completely renovated, funded by Dublin businessman and distiller Henry Roe.\n\nA group of students are given a tour of the crypt of the cathedral.\n\n‘The House of Strongbow’ was broadcast on 25 April 1978.

        "Description": "The Civil Defence provides training to protect the population in the event of war.\n\nThe Dublin City Rescue Service carry out a simulated rescue operation in the event of a bomb attack at Ratra House in the Phoenix Park Dublin.\n\nThese are certainly dedicated people who do all their training in their spare time.\n\nMr J Fay, National Director of Civil Defence, explains what civil defence is all about.\n\nCivil Defence means the efforts being made to organise the population to protect themselves against the effects of war, including particularly nuclear war.\n\nWhen planning civil defence, order is required. The government has placed the hazard of radioactive fallout as the country’s biggest threat. Plans are made under the assumption that nuclear explosions could occur anywhere in the country and the Civil Defence must be prepared to act at short notice. To prepare for such events, the Civil Defence School has been established at the Phoenix Park. People are sent forward for training at the centre by their local authority. Courses are also carried out for An Garda Síochána, the army and other professionals such as water engineers and agricultural inspectors.\n\nChief Technical Officer at the Civil Defence School, Dr Aubrey Crawford explains how a chain of command operates throughout Ireland. The country is divided into eight regions made up of a number of counties. The counties are then subdivided into sub-counties and each sub-area is divided into districts which are again subdivided into warden post areas. In each of these areas, there are control posts.\n\nYou have a chain of command and control running right up.\n\nWardens in each of the districts use equipment to detect radioactive readings. Technical officer Mr Maher describes the different types of instruments used to detect radioactivity including the individual dosimeter, the different types of survey meters, and a contamination meter. Each of the instruments has different levels of sensitivity for measuring radioactivity.\n\nIf people are exposed to too much radiation, it would kill them and these instruments can tell exactly how much radiation is knocking around.\n\nAnother technical officer, Mr Dunne, describes some of the equipment required to feed people in the event of an attack where there is a loss of electricity or gas power. These include single and double dustbin ovens, a stockpot boiler and a series of basic cookers for pot boiling. All of these devices are made from debris which can be found following a bomb blast. The mobile feeding units are designed to feed two thousand people every four hours.\n\nIf there is a nuclear war, you may not know what to do, I may not know what to do, but at least it’s good to know that in this country there are people who can tell us.\n\nAn RTÉ News report broadcast on 2 July 1962.\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.

        "Description": "The Orange celebrations in Ulster begin on 1st July when many parades take place to commemorate the Battle of the Somme and culminate in the spectacular parades of the Twelfth Day.\n\nThe Twelfth celebrations are characterised first and foremost by their colour, music and vitality. However, for many, the deep-rooted tradition behind the festivities is overshadowed by the political element. To correct the balance, ‘The Sash My Father Wore’ takes a sympathetic view of the July celebrations. There is no analysis, just a commentary from lifelong Orange Order members Joe Gibson and Billy McKeon.\n\nBilly McKeon believes life is too short for sectarianism. For thirty years he worked in Belfast as a bus driver in the predominantly nationalist Short Strand Depot where his Roman Catholic colleagues christened him ‘Orange Billy’. He had to ask a Catholic for time off on the Twelfth, but this was never a problem.\n\nMcKeon would have loved to have been a great musician. He competed on the pipe in the All Ireland Contest and has played in Dublin and Howth with pipe bands. As he sees it, the very existence of a band in Northern Ireland is primarily to take part in the Twelfth demonstration or any other Orange demonstrations.\n\nSpeaking as an Ulster man, I must confess that I know all the Orange tunes, and the Twelfth of July wouldn’t be the Twelfth of July if I didn’t hear ‘The Sash’ and ‘Dolly’s Ring’ and one or two others.\n\n‘The Sash My Father Wore’ was first broadcast on 12 July 1976.

        "Description": "Knowledge of early Christianity in Ireland has come mainly from written text sources.\n\nLittle of the material evidence of Ireland’s early years remains with much of the information about early Christian Ireland gathered from written sources rather than from monuments or shrines.\n\nThe Christianity of Ireland was a powerful force exerting mighty influence at home and abroad.\n\nIn 431, Christian writer and disciple of Augustine of Hippo, Prosper of Aquitaine, wrote,\n\nAd Scotum in Christum credentes, to the Irish believing in Christ, Palladius has sent use their first bishop\n\nThis is a clear indication that prior to 431 when Palladius came to organise them, there was a sufficient body of Christians already in Ireland to warrant his mission. It is thought that these Christians were located mainly in the south, an area which had been in close contact with the mainland of Europe. It is considered that they were organised on a diocesan basis, similar to how the church was administered in Europe. There are no certain relics of this early period of Christianity in Ireland with the possible exception of a reliquary box found with a skeleton in a stone lined grave beneath the round tower in Dromiskin, County Louth.\n\nA carefully hollowed stone box with a sliding lid containing a smaller wooden hollow box also with a sliding lid and secured by a bar of bronze.\n\nIt is not clear how long the Roman system of diocesan organisation lasted but it was not too long before Patrick, the successor of Palladius, was able to the write that the sons and daughters of the Irish were in great numbers becoming monks and virgins of Christ. In the 5th century, monasticism arrived in Ireland.\n\n‘Heritage: Island of Saints’ was broadcast on 12 July 1967. The presenter is Dr Joseph Raftery and the programme was produced by Pat Baker.\n\nThe programme ‘Heritage’ was a seven part survey of Irish archaeology from early times to the Cistercian Reform and the Norman Invasion. It was written by Dr Joseph Raftery, President of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA).\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.

The rest is history.\n\nJohn Hurt was fortunate enough to meet his hero Samuel Beckett although it was only once he remembers the occasion fondly and was surprised to find him reading the racing pages.\n\nThis episode of The Late Late Show was broadcast on 22 February 2002.

        "Description": "A visit to Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in Buncrana seen through the eyes of a young man from Ballyfermot.\n\nFleadh Cheoil na hÉireann, a national festival of traditional Irish music established by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, was first held in Mullingar in 1951. Over the years the Fleadh Cheoil has been held in many different towns throughout Ireland and in August 1975 it was the turn of Buncrana, County Donegal.\n\nThis was the first time the festival had been hosted in Donegal. RTÉ producer Tom Walsh was in Buncrana to capture the sights and sounds of the festival for television.\n\nCommenting on the programme in the RTÉ Guide Tom Walsh says,\n\n\"I deliberately have no commentary. The idea behind the film is to capture the flavour of the event. To make that even more real, we see the Fleadh through the eyes of a young lad from Ballyfermot, Terry Flood.\"\n\nThis approach means that the cameras stay mainly on the streets, recording impromptu sessions from folk musicians to be found at every corner of Buncrana.\n\nThe programme follows Terry Flood from Ballyfermot in Dublin as he wanders the streets taking in the music of the festival.\n\nThe programme ‘Fleadh Cheoil in Donegal’ was broadcast on Easter Monday 19 April 1976. The programme was broadcast again in 1991 to mark 40 years of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.\n\nThe Fleadh Cheoil was hosted again in Buncrana the following year in 1976.\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.

The tourist board has long aimed to attract more visitors to the River Shannon, which remains quieter than expected. While cruising numbers increased slightly last year, many companies struggle to survive. The cost to navigate through locks and bridges is a mere 17 pence, unchanged for years. A lock keeper suggests a price increase could benefit maintenance and appeal to tourists. This report is part of a series examining tourism in the River Shannon region, featuring music from Wicklow ballad group Aisling.

He highlights the issue of property owners using the threat of leaving sites derelict as leverage to gain unreasonable planning permissions. McHugh believes that imposing a tax on these properties would incentivize owners to develop them, thereby reducing the number of eyesores in the city. He also suggests that if taxes are not paid, local authorities should have the power to acquire and sell these sites to interested developers. This policy, McHugh argues, would help preserve older buildings and rejuvenate inner cities. This RTÉ News report was broadcast on 26 April 1984, with Tom MacSweeney reporting.",

        "Description": "Dolores O’Riordan, the lead singer of The Cranberries, discusses her leg injury, married life, touring, and more. Following the success of their debut album, 'Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?', O’Riordan knew their second album would be challenging. 'No Need to Argue', released in late 1994, surpassed expectations and topped charts in Australia, Germany, and Belgium. However, a knee injury led to the sudden cancellation of three homecoming concerts in December 1994. Dolores explains the importance of prioritizing health despite the disappointment it caused fans.\n\nDuring the interview, O’Riordan dispels rumors about cranberry sauce being banned in her home, humorously noting her family's preference for bacon and cabbage. She also shares her joy about marrying Don Burton, Duran Duran’s tour manager, in 1994 and her plans to build a home in Kerry. Despite her fame, she aims to maintain a normal life when not touring. Her mother, Eileen, proudly confirms that fame hasn't changed her daughter.\n\nThe Cranberries are set to resume touring in London and Germany, record an MTV Unplugged show, and play summer festivals with REM. This episode of ‘Kenny Live’ was broadcast on 16 January 1995, presented by Pat Kenny.",

        "Description": "In 1324, the bustling city of Kilkenny witnessed Ireland's first witch trial. Dame Alice Kyteler, wealthy and beautiful, drew suspicion due to her four marriages and the mysterious deaths of her husbands. Rumors of a tall dark man visiting her house and the sudden wealth of her son, Robert, fueled the allegations. The Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, led the trial against Alice and her maid, Petronella.\n\nA neighbor's testimony about witnessing Alice's strange practices on a May morning played a crucial role in their conviction. Despite the grave charges, Alice remained silent throughout the trial. Both women were sentenced to death, but Alice mysteriously vanished from her cell, leaving only smoke and flame marks behind. Petronella, however, was burned at the stake two weeks later.\n\nThis chilling tale is recounted by storyteller Eddie Lenihan in 'Ten Minute Tales', originally broadcast on 21 January 1988.",

People in difficulty or in need of essential food supplies should contact their local Garda station. The helicopters are also being used to assist the ESB in restoring electrical power. The Automobile Association (AA) has warned that most roads throughout the country are still in dangerous condition. While many roads have reopened, there are fears that freezing temperatures will again make them impassable. The AA advises drivers to stay off the roads.\n\nAn RTÉ News report broadcast on 10 January 1982.

        "Description": "The heaviest snowfall across Ireland for decades results in traffic chaos, fuel and food shortages, and the closure of schools and workplaces. Transport, communications, and electricity supplies were badly disrupted in the worst cold spell since 1963. Brendan O’Brien reports on how the severe weather conditions are impacting towns along the east coast, with emergency services having huge demands placed upon them. Five helicopters from the Army Air Corps made more than twenty mercy missions from Baldonnel Aerodrome. One of the most frequent emergency calls involved pregnant women in labor. Almost 24 hours after the first snowfall, many people are having to fend for themselves, digging a way out of snow drifts and clearing roads. Up to 50 people are still stuck at the Aeromotive factory in Dublin. The Naas Road has come to a standstill as people attempt to dig themselves out of the snow drifts. Train stations and airports have also been forced to close, with 400 people having to spend the night at Heuston Station, trapped as a result of frozen railway points. The Dublin airport road was effectively impassable in places, as were most main roads in and out of the capital. Many small towns on the east coast are almost cut off from food supplies, with people now queuing for limited supplies of bread. Around 55,000 homes, mainly in rural areas, were without electricity today. The ESB is working tirelessly to return services, with about 25,000 homes in isolated areas remaining blacked out.\n\nAn RTÉ News report broadcast on 9 January 1982.

The Drumanagh headland in north County Dublin, just across the bay from Loughshinny harbour, is easily identifiable by its nineteenth-century Martello tower. Archaeologist and local resident Dr. Peter Harbison explains that evidence of an empire from much further in time was discovered in 1947, and other artefacts from the site exist which are Roman in character and which suggest a settlement of people from Roman Britain. Harbison believes that legal difficulties are the main reasons standing in the way of a full-scale archaeological dig that could provide answers to many questions about the Drumanagh promontory. The headland is frequented by locals exercising and walking their dogs, and they want to see it protected, says local historian Declan Stack.\n\nAn RTÉ News broadcast on 22 January 1996.

    "Description": "This 'Radharc' film explores the lives of Irish men working on the construction of a nuclear power plant at Oldbury, Bristol, England in 1965. Living in a purpose-built camp away from the nearest towns, these men share their experiences of working in such a challenging environment.\n\nThe film includes interviews with Irish workers discussing their living conditions, pay, and the loneliness of being away from home. Father Peter Lemass, who reports on the site, emphasizes the importance of the workers' well-being, as employers must provide food, accommodation, and recreational facilities.\n\nThe film portrays the men as nomadic workers who long to return to Ireland, though many end up staying in England longer than planned. The report highlights the difficulties of maintaining family ties and the struggle to find a sense of belonging.\n\nContact Information:\n\nFor any concerns or issues regarding the video, please contact us at vintagearchivecontact@gmail.com.\n\nIf you have any copyright issues, we kindly ask that you reach out to us directly before filing a copyright strike with YouTube.
