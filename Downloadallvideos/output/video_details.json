        "Description": "Western Movie in Full Length: Blood at Sundown - Spaghetti Western - Twelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend.\n\nBlood at Sundown (1966)\nDirector: Alberto Cardone (as Albert Cardiff)\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi (story), Vittorio Salerno (story) \nStars: Anthony Steffen, Gianni Garko, Erika Blanc\nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy, West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 18 December 1966 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: $1,000 on the Black\nFilming Locations: Elios Film, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nTwelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend. Now the town's undisputed boss and doted over by his possessive mother, Sartana seems safe - until, his sentence served, Johnny rides back into town.\n\nReviews:\n\"Steffen and Garko have been in a lot of awful movies, no doubt about that, so \"Sartana\" can easily be considered a climax in their careers, respectively.\n\nIt's the story of two brothers fighting each other, Steffen playing the straight and honest one, Garko portraying a sadistic, screaming blond loony. Their mother tries to stop him. Intense pictures, intense emotions, the director even alluded to Shakespearean tragedies a few times, but you needn't take that too seriously. All in all, well done, spaghetti western above average.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Decent and morally upright Johnny Liston (an excellent and sympathetic performance by Anthony Steffen) gets out of jail after serving twelve years. He vows to get revenge on his evil and ruthless despot brother Sartana (robustly played with deliciously vicious aplomb by Gianni Garko), who framed Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend Manuela Holt (lovely Angelica Ott). Director Alberto Cardone, working from a dark and uncompromising script by Ernesto Gestaldi and Rolf Olsen, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, does an expert job of creating and sustaining an extremely tough and gritty tone, milks the potent sibling rivalry theme for all it's worth, and stages the rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs and stirring shoot-outs with considerable gusto. Steffen and Garko do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive able support from Erika Blanc as the fiery Joselita, Robert Miali as hapless browbeaten mute Jerry, Carla Calo as the bitter, boozy Rhonda Liston, Franco Fantasia as the weak, ineffectual sheriff, Sieghardt Rupp as the nasty Ralph, and Carlo D'Angelo as the crooked, slippery Judge Waldorf. Gino Santini's sumptuous cinematography offers plenty of bold and startling compositions (the sweeping panoramic shots of the dusty and desolate desert are especially striking and impressive). Michele Lacerenza's twangy and harmonic score likewise hits the flavorsome spot. But it's the film's remarkably hard and harsh no-nonsense mood which in turn gives this movie an extra jolting edge: the villains are truly hateful and sadistic, the outbursts of violence are quite savage and shocking (even women and children aren't spared from the copious brutality), and the climactic bloodbath is both wild and exciting. Well worth seeing.\" Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 1000 dollari sul nero\nArgentina: El látigo del Diablo\nBrazil: Johnny Texas\nFrance: Les colts de la violence\nGreece (transliterated title): Oi epikirygmenoi\nGreece (video title): Aima ston ilio\nHungary (TV title): Ezer dollárt a feketére\nItaly (reissue title): Sartana: Sangue e la penna\nJapan (Japanese title): 砂塵に血を吐け\nNetherlands (informal literal title): Duel Bij Zonsondergang\nPortugal: Mil dolares no preto\nSpain: Baño de sangre al salir del sol\nSpain (alternative title): 1000 dólares al negro\nSweden: Blod i sol - 1.000 svarta dollar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Altın sarı kan kırmızı\nUK: Blood at Sundown\nUK (TV title): 1000 dollari sul nero (subtitle $1000 On Black)\nUSA: Blood at Sundown\nUSA: One Thousand Dollars on the Black\nUSA: $1,000 on the Black\nWest Germany: Sartana\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

As the semi-inebriated sheriff decides not to take action, the priest's young protégé, Johnny, gambles with death to find the deceased's twin brother, Lewis, in Mexico, and talk him into settling the score.

Lee Van Cleef does an excellent job playing the role of Father John and the role of Lewis. Jack Palace was excellent in his role as Sam Clayton. The reason I bought this movie was Sybil Danning. You didn't see much of Sybil Danning body in this because it was a western but, she was excellent in her role as Jenny the owner of the saloon. Her talents as an actress really shined in this picture. So, with that in mind, and because this movie kept my interest through the entire picture I'm giving this movie 10 weasels stars because of Sybil Danning and the level of action , adventure and drama this movie had from beginning to end. \"\n- written by \"garyldibert\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Diamante Lobo\nAustralia God's Gun\nBrazil A Pistola de Deus(cable TV title)\nBrazil A Arma Divina\nBulgaria Оръжието на Господ(Bulgarian)\nCanada God's Gun(English)\nDenmark Den blodige bande\nFinland Villi joukko\nFrance Les impitoyables\nGreece Το όπλο του Θεού\nGreece Το πιστόλι είναι ο Θεός μου(Alternative Title)\nHungary Isten fegyvere\nIndia God's Gun(English)\nItaly Diamante Lobo\nLithuania Dievo ginklas\nNorway God's Gun\nNorway Clapton-Banden(video box title)\nPortugal A Pistola de Deus\nRomania Arma lui D-zeu\nSoviet Union Оружие Господне(Russian)\nSpain Seis balas... una venganza... una oración\nSweden Det blodiga gänget\nSweden Hämndens kulor(Video Title)\nTurkey Tanrı'nın Silahı(Turkish)\nUnited Kingdom God's Gun\nUnited States God's Gun\nWest Germany Der Colt Gottes\nYugoslavia Heroj na crniot kolt(Macedonian)\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

On the run from Jurago, a former partner he has crossed, Clint accepts Johnny's help, and agrees to surrender ..... for now.\n\nReviews:\n\"Fans of Italian Western will know Gianni Garko (aka Gerry Hudson) as Western Hero Sartana in many of his later movies. The first scene with the wonderful Fernando Sancho will remind you on Sartana but this time Gianni Garko will be another main Character. In \"Per 100,000 dollari ti ammazzo\" he is Johnny Forest (in some alternate Version round the world Django) a man who was accused to have killed his father by his brother. After years in prison he became a bounty hunter and his brother an outlaw. Johnny Forest chases his brother. The background to the Cain/Abel story is set place during the civil war. There are several interesting scenes including brutality of war and melodramatic sequences. As there are some flashback scenes and some atmospheric scenes in a ghost town. These flashbacks are the highlights of this movie and important for the story of the main characters. Overall the music score is very good but in the flashback scenes a bit too overwhelming.\n\nIf you are looking for Westerns from Italy with lesser Action but more Story and atmospheric scenes \"100.000 dollari di ammazzo\" should be for you.\" Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com\n\n\"Nice Italian Western with sad atmosphere ,full of feeling ,wonderful musical score and special appearance by the great Fernando Sancho . This is a very entertaining SW from Giovanni Fago and the prolific western and horror screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing¨ deals with two brothers hate until death since one of them killed their father. [...] Johnny Forest, tries to carry out his mother's dying wish that he brings in his outlaw brother, Clint, alive. On the run from Jurago, a former pal he has betrayed , Clint accepts Johnny's help, and agrees to surrender . But his lover ( Claudie Lange))is kidnapped and Forest seeks vengeance .\n\nAcceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual Ernesto Gastaldi, splendid cinematography by Federico Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi. It's a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios, as invincible and tough antiheroes, difficult and fast showdowns with numerous deceases, impulsive and quick zooms, lots of action, musical score with Morricone influence .\" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Per 100.000 dollari t'ammazzo\nBrazil (reissue title): Promessa de Sangue\nBrazil: Pistoleiros em Conflito\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Убийство за 100 000 долара\nChile: Tu cabeza por mil dólares\nFinland: Kosto veressä\nFrance: Le jour de la haine\nGreece (transliterated title): Kremaste tous ektos nomou\nItaly: Per 100.000 dollari t'ammazzo\nPortugal: A Vingança É Minha\nSweden (alternative title): Hämnden är ljuv\nSweden: 100.000 dollar för att döda\nUSA: Vengeance is Mine\nUSA: $100,000 for a Killing\nWest Germany: Django der Bastard\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): Potera za 100 000 dolara\n For One Hundred Thousand Dollars for a Killing\n One Hundred Thousand Dollars Per Killing\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Almost everyone in the tiny town of Indian Creek seems eager to buy up the property left behind by the murder victims, and one of them could well be behind the killings. The sheriff himself is not above suspicion, so Sartana must uncover the culprit all on his own.\n\nReviews:\n\"Garko and Carnimeo cooperated in some good Italo-Westerns in the late 60s/early 70s, most remarkable is the \"Sartana\"-Series. This is definitely one of the best Sartana-Movies; tough, cynical and with a lot of humor, seasoned with all herbs of an excellent italo-western. The plot has some twists, good shoot-outs and a decent body count. The soundtrack's fine, good work done by Bruno Nicolai. The cast is standard with lot's of Italian b-movie heroes (ruffini, dell' acqua...) I had a lot of fun with this movie and it's worth watching it more than one time.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Death Is Sweet from the Soldier of God - A former sheriff, after being accused of a robbery and escaping from jail with a revolutionary bandit, seeks revenge for his brother and his family.\n\nDeath Is Sweet from the Soldier of God (1972)\nDirector: Roberto Mauri (as Robert Johnson)\nWriters: Roberto Mauri (story), Roberto Bianchi Montero (story) (as Roberto Montero) \nStars: Brad Harris, José Torres, Maretta Procaccini \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 2 April 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Er säte den Tod \nFilming Locations: Incir De Paolis Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline: \nA former sheriff, after being accused of a robbery and escaping from jail with a revolutionary bandit, seeks revenge for his brother and his family.\n\nReviews:\n\"Brad Harris had signed a contract for three westerns with a production company called Three Stars, but only two of the three movies were completed, Wanted Sabata and Arriva Durango, Paga o Muori. This third part (See Database Page) was produced by another company, and is said to be an assembly of re-edited scenes of the first two movies, with a couple of new scenes added (*1). The film is best know for a couple of great titles (in Italian and English) plus a wonderful poster design, also used for various releases of the movie on VHS and DVD. Biggest throwback: the scene depicted on the poster, is not in the movie.\n\nHarris is Durango (Django in some versions) and he’s a former sheriff falsely accused of a robbery. He ends up in jail with a guy called Spirito Santo, who was arrested for steeling money he needed for the revolution and his poor family at home in Mexico - at least that’s what he says (he also pretends to be one-eyed). The two are sprung out of jail by a mystery man and subsequently join a gang of Mexicans who are looking for the stolen strongbox: Durango to prove his innocence, Santo to collect money for the revolution. We also get a vengeance tale, with Durango looking for the man who killed his brother and his wife.\n\nAs one might expect from an assembly movie, Death is Sweet ... doesn’t hang together. The vengeance tale is particularly stupid: Durango tracks down the killer and takes his revenge, but an earlier scene clearly showed that this man - played by Vassili Karis - was not responsible for the slayings; when he arrived on the spot, Durango’s relatives were already dead and he has been trying to eliminate Durango ever since, because he - Durango - would never believe that he was innocent. What nonsense! Is the movie worth tracking down? Harris is his usual self, steady as a rock and acting like one, but the patchwork seems to hurt Torres' performance: In Arriva Durango ... his hyperactive style worked well in combination with Harris' stoicism, but here his character has no consistency and his overzealous routines - invoking la madre de Dios every other minute or so - quickly become annoying. For completists only. But that poster is a killer.\" Written by Simon Gelten on spaghetti-western.net.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Seminò morte... lo chiamavano il Castigo di Dio!\nGermany: Er säte den Tod\nGreece (transliterated title): Ton fonazan Pistola\nItaly: Seminò morte... lo chiamavano il Castigo di Dio!\nUSA: Death Is Sweet from the Soldier of God\nUSA: Django...

        "Title": "A Bullet for the General | Spaghetti Western | Action | Free Western Movie",
        "Description": "Spaghetti Western starring Klaus Kinski: A Bullet for the General - A band of Mexican gun-runners employed by a revolutionary general accept an American into their gang, unaware of his intentions.\n\nA Bullet for the General (1967)\nDirector: Damiano Damiani\nWriters: Salvatore Laurani (story and screenplay), Franco Solinas (adaptation)\nStars: Gian Maria Volontè, Klaus Kinski, Martine Beswick\nGenres: Action, Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 7 June 1968 (West Germany)\nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nIn the rough years of the revolution in Mexico, the hardened bandit chief, El Chucho, is in need of arms, ammunition, and a much-sought-after machine gun to support the leader of the revolution, the rebel General, Elías. With this in mind, Chucho attacks a government supply train and gets an unforeseen assistance from Bill Tate--the American gringo in the impeccable suit--with whom will soon become friends. Now, Bill is truly indispensable to the gang, however, could he be hiding his true objective behind a boyish and calm face? Written by Nick Riganas\n\nReviews:\n\"I agree with the other viewers how wonderful this film is. However they seem to miss the real point of the film. Made in 1967 during the Vietnam war, this film is really a comment on US policies in the world. It is a classic of the genre of euro intellectual leftist anti imperial US films of the time, beautifully done. Damiano in his films obviously likes and respects Americans, just not the imperial thing.\n\nRegardless of your politics it is important to see this film for what it is really is. For an old lefty like me I kept thinking \"where was this film in the early 70's when I was in college\". I would have loved it then, as much as I loved seeing it now, almost 30 years after it birth.\" Written by jam55 on IMDb.com\n\n\"An Italian crude version of west and an Italian vision of the reality of late sixty years of XX century The late sixties were the same year of first feeble Italian crime/police films that explained the crude real life of the period named as \"lead years\", terrorism, murders and kidnapping. This film is the prelude to all these fact. Gian Maria Volontè superb acting piece also in a low cost production, dialogs very essential and with a little bit of anarchy sense. I saw this film at 7 - 8 years old with my grandpa in an old smoky cinema and was for me not bloodiest not like other actual films. A real must for all kids mature and experts. Note also the presence of a less known Klaus Kinsky as El Chuncho's brother.\" Written by Cambronne on IMDb.com\n\n\"Always been a big spaghetti western fan and this is one of the best. Damiano Damiani's 1966 film is set against the Mexican revolution and tells the story of a bandit - the wonderful Gian Maria Volonté and his gang who terrorise the Govt troops and relieve them of their weapons that they sell to the revolutionary general.\n\nThey meet up with an American (Lou Castel) who joins them but whose motives they suspect.\n\nThere are spectacular train attacks , mega-massacres and piched battles along the way but the film has a strong moral sense allied with an almost Marxist viewpoint.\n\nOn several occasions we see Volente wrestling with doing the right thing and doing the thing that will pay him. The script is exellent and although most is dubbed (as always with these movies)the storyline is as engrossing as the action. Klaus Kinski has fun as the mad priest/bandit and the whole thing looks terrific in a 2:35 print really utilising the huge landscapes.\n\nThere is a terrific moment at the end where one character does a simple thing and the other character suddenly realises what has been going on all along.\n\nA truly terrific picture and in feel not that far away from Leones'later Fistful of Dynamite.\" Written by steve_b33 on IMDb.com\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Assault on Fort Texan - Spaghetti Western - During the Civil War, a group of confederate soldiers with the help of Apache Indians, try to defeat a Union fort, while trying to gain support from Emperor Maximillian of Mexico. \n\nAssault on Fort Texan (1965)\nDirector: Alberto De Martino (as Martin Herbert)\nWriters: Alberto De Martino (as Herbert Martin), Eduardo Manzanos (screenplay) (as Silver Bem)\nStars: Edmund Purdom, Paul Piaget, Mónica Randall \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Spain | Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 21 May 1965 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 7° de caballería \n\nStoryline:\nThe year is 1863. And while the Civil War rages back east, a Confederate regiment is trying to make its way through Texas to Mexico. Problem is, the Union 5th and 7th cavalry are blocking the escape route.\n\nSo the Confederates, using Col. George Bonnett (Eduardo Fajardo) as an intermediary, form an alliance with Apache Chief Wild Horse.\n\nThe plan is simple: Wild Horse’s warriors will attack a nearby settlement, luring the Union cavalry out of the protection of the fort. Then more Indians will attack the undermanned fort.\n\nAnd that strategy works to perfection, leading to the annihilation of the 5th Cavalry. Defeating the 7th with the same plan might not be as easy,\n\nThe 7th has a reliable junior officer in Maj. Sam Allison (Paul Piaget). And he’s counting on an assist from reluctant Maj. Sugar Patterson (Edmund Purdom), who’s time in uniform is almost up and who would rather be drinking and womanizing than soldiering.\n\nAt least until a pretty Indian girl named Amanda (Monica Randall) catches his eye. Then there’s a question of what to do with the pretty saloon singer named Nelly (Ida Galli). As harmless as she looks, could she really be a Confederate spy? Written by Mark Franklin\n\nReviews:\n\"Take the Civil War, add a horde of marauding Apache, two lovely ladies and a pair of large-scale cavalry vs. Indian battles, and you should be able to put together an entertaining Western.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is too silly too often to be taken the least bit seriously.\n\nTake the stagecoach robbery that opens the film. A gun battle breaks out in which everyone is killed but the stage driver, the shotgun guard and two female passengers. One of the females says everyone is dead; they might as well get going. And they do, leaving the heroic male passengers lying dead in the dust with the bandits!\n\nIt’s a sign of things to come. Later, the commander of the Union fort dies in a scene that must be seen to be believed. Then, during his funeral ceremony, a warning bell rings. Indians are attacking a nearby settlement; it might be wiped out.\n\nToo damn bad, decides the new commanding officer. The ceremony will go on, regardless of how many settlers are being massacred just short charge away.\n\nPaul Piaget plays the straight-laced officer who gives that order, but Maj. Sugar Patterson is the star of this show. He’s a lovable rogue who opens the film in the guardhouse, for insubordination, of course.\n\nHe’s decorated his cell with drawings of shapely women and his time of service is about to run out. But he keeps finding himself being drawn back into the action, both out of self-preservation and a sense of duty.\n\nOne night, he heads out to scout an Indian village with Piaget’s character. Moments later, he’s kissing one of the prettiest little Indian squaws you’ll ever find in a Spaghetti Western.\n\nTurns out she’s named Amanda. And later on, she plays guitar as a ruse so her new girlfriend Nelly can escape from Sugar. Yep, more silliness.\" Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Gli eroi di Fort Worth\nBelgium (French title): Fort Texan\nBrazil: A Carga do 7o. de Cavalaria\nCanada (French title): L'assaut du fort Texan\nFrance: L'assaut du Fort Texan\nGreece (transliterated title): Apache, ta tsakalia tis Dyseos\nGreece (reissue title): Epelasis tis 7is taxiarhias\nMexico: La carga del séptimo escuadrón\nSpain: El séptimo de caballería\nSpain (DVD title): 7° de caballería\nUSA: Assault on Fort Texan\nUSA: Charge of the Seventh Cavalry\nUSA: Heroes of Fort Worth\nWest Germany: Vergeltung am Wichita-Pass\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Spaghetti Western: Django Kill... If You Live, Shoot! - Various factions, feud over stolen gold in a surreal town. \n\nDjango Kill... If You Live, Shoot! (1967)\nDirector: Giulio Questi\nWriters: Franco Arcalli (story and screenplay), Giulio Questi (story and screenplay)\nStars: Tomas Milian, Marilù Tolo, Piero Lulli\nRuntime: 1h 54min\nGenres: Horror, Western\nCountry: Italy, Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 3 May 1967 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Django - Leck Staub von meinem Colt\nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nThe Stranger, a half-breed bandit, is part of a band of thieves that steal a cargo of gold from a stagecoach. However, the Americans in the band betray him, and shoot all the Mexicans. The Stranger is not completely dead though, and crawls his way out of his shallow grave, continuing his pursuit of the gold, and exacting a bloody vengeance. Written by David Gibson\n\nReviews:\n\"This is really a cult within a cult. The first few scenes are the standard revenge and search for gold spaghetti fare. However, after the bandits entire the strange town, the movie really enters a surreal land. I was quite bemused watching the various sub-plots but it was extremely compelling. It gives the impression of two scriptwriters who love westerns just brainstorming the most outrageous script. Despite its confused feel I give it 10/10 as it has many startling, original and occasionally jaw dropping moments'. Highlights are , 'digging for gold in the bandit', Zorro the 'affable sadist', the black-shirted gay muchachos, the commentary by the parrot and the liquids gold 'House of Wax scene. What the 'traditionalist American Cowboy fans make of the gay muchachos, god only knows. Highly recommended.\" Written by washboard on IMDb.com\n\n\"DJANGO KILL is one excellent Spaghetti Western. The only problem with the film is that it loses steam by the end and it's a shame because if the direction, the pacing and the story had remained the same throughout the movie as during the first hour, this would have been a masterpiece. The direction is truly unique and there's something contemporary about the whole first hour. But when the action starts resembling a soap opera of sorts, the greatness of the beginning is almost completely gone. But even if the second half is not as spectacular as the first half, DJANGO KILL is still one of the best Euro westerns I've ever seen.

        "Description": "Spaghetti Western: Arizona Colt Returns - Famed gunman Arizona Colt is sent by Moreno to rescue his daughter from the grips of Arizona's old enemy, Keane. But certain complications make the mission far more dangerous than expected.\n\nArizona Colt Returns (1970)\nDirector: Sergio Martino\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi, Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent\nStars: Anthony Steffen, Marcella Michelangeli, Aldo Sambrell\nGenre: Western\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 14 August 1970 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Arizona Colt, Hired Gun\n\nStoryline: \nFamed gunman Arizona Colt is sent by Moreno to rescue his daughter from the grips of Arizona's old enemy, Keane. But certain complications make the mission far more dangerous than expected.\n\nReviews:\n\"Of Course there are better, but I know a lot of spaghetti-western which are unbelievable worst. To start to write about the story is to explain the whole movie. It is a simple one, like other spaghetti-western, Arizona (the typical antihero) against a bunch of bandits. His funny sidekick has a silly name: Double Whiskey. You will see humor, cold blooded killing, torture and a lot of shooting. So everything someone can expect from an average spaghetti-western. There is nothing in this movie, you couldn't see in other spaghetti-western.\n\n\"Arizona Colt Returns\", or whatever the name is, is not a bad one, but it isn't a good one either. For spaghetti-western standards the violence is normal and not too brutal. So it isn't an ugly dirty one either. What is the best of this western? Maybe Anthony Steffen (or Anthonio De Teffé) as Arizona, but I liked his sidekick Double-Whiskey too. There are some scenes where these 2 characters are really funny together. I liked to watch the beautiful and good actress Rosalba Neri. Some more scenes with her would be helpful for this movie. Sometimes it seems that Rosalba was a little bit underchallenged in her role. Most of the other actors you have already seen in Movies made in Italy from that period. The sounds of composer Bruno Nicolai are great in this movie. Maybe the music is too good for a cheap movie like that.\n\nOverall I must say that \"Arizona Colt Returns\" was entertaining. And I think this is the most important thing about a movie like this. I had the luck to watch this movie with a not so poor quality. When you are someone who likes Western from Europe (even the worst), then you will enjoy \"Arizona Colt Returns\".\" Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"During the first few minutes, the movie seems to be a comedy, introducing Double Whiskey (Roberto Camardiel) and the lazy gunman Arizona Colt (Anthony Steffen) who does not even pick up a job for a lot of money. Yet it soon turns into a serious and violent western, a typical production for its time and the genre debut of \"Mannaja\" director Sergio Martino. Intended to be a sequel to \"Arizona Colt\" with Giuliano Gemma, it has little in common with the earlier movie, since Anthony Steffen plays a slower, darker, heavier type of character.

We spag western fans are always searching for the next \"good one\" and let me tell you, there are many \"bad ones\" to wade through in the process. I want him dead has been called gritty in every review i have ever read about it and it is. It is also a kick but revenge western with a kick butt Craig Hill performance. He has also done a few other spags worth mention. The dirty fifteen aka. fifteen scaffolds for the killers and no graves on boot hill by Sergio Garrone being at the top of my list. I want him dead has great camera work and the score is superb. It fits the film like a glove. Jose Manuel Martin plays the antagonist and many other spag regulars will be spotted by any fan of the genre. I have the Franco Cleef version of the film. To my knowledge it is the best English language version available. Franco Cleef is the man!! Go Franco Go!!!!!! He puts together English language versions of rare spag westerns for English speaking fans that would have no other way to watch these fantastic films.

        "Description": "Old Cowboy Movie: The Moment to Kill - Lord and Bull are two adventurers recruited by Judge Warren for a mysterious mission. On reaching the village to know the details of the mission they don't find the judge and discover that many people want them dead.\n\nThe Moment to Kill (1968)\nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo (as Anthony Ascott)\nWriters: Tito Carpi (screenplay), Enzo G. Castellari (idea) \nStars: George Hilton, Walter Barnes, Horst Frank\nGenre: Western, Action\nCountry: Italy | West Germany\nLanguage: Italian\nRelease Date: 28 November 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: The Moment of Killing \nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\n\"To unearth $500,000 in gold hidden by a Confederate colonel after his death, Judge Warren enlists the help of the notorious gunslingers, Lord and Bull. However, this is a delicate and challenging mission, as the pair's only clues lead them to a dusty small town where the colonel's relatives, the mighty Forrester family, have, too, set their sights on finding the gold. Now, Lord and Bull find themselves up against an entire army of cut-throats, bent on getting them out of the way. Will they make it out of this death trap alive and in one piece?\" Written by Nick Riganas on IMDb.com \n\nReviews:\n\"The second Western from Giuliano Carnimeo is a perfect production with a great cast. George Hilton and Walter Barnes are a perfect team and on the other side the great german actor Horst Frank. As Regina Loni von Friedl is also very good and insidious. Responsible for the good looking of the movie is Stelvio Massi with his camerawork. The movie has also a ironic sense of humor which is very good for it. Francesco de Masi did a great job with the wunderfull music. Giuliano Carnimeo and George Hilton made also a few other good movies together f.ex. the Giallo \"Perché quelle strane gocce di sangue sul corpo di Jennifer?\" or the western- comedy \" Il West ti va stretto, amico ... è arrivato Alleluja\". Carnimeo is also responsible for three of the Sartana- movies with Gianni Garko.\" Written by garko80 on IMDb.com \n\n\"The DVD company Wild East put this out with another George Hilton spaghetti western on the same disc, \"Full House For The Devil\". The two compliment each other, and not in a good way. This is a pretty poor western. The first third of the movie is very confusing, with motivations by the various characters murky. Eventually we learn what's going on, but the movie doesn't really improve with that knowledge. The story remains very slow-moving, and the sporadic action sequences are not particularly exciting. The two protagonists (played by Hilton and Walter Barnes) are not very likable, coming across as kind of smug and cold-hearted. Is there anything of merit to be found here? Well, the opening credits song is not bad, and the director occasionally pulls off an interesting visual. But I think even the biggest spaghetti western fans won't find this limited merit enough to make the movie worth investing their time with.\" Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Know As (AKA)\n(original title) Il momento di uccidere\nArgentina (poster title) Gratis no mato\nBrazil Bandoleiros Violentos em Fúria\nBrazil Hora de Matar\nChile El momento de matar\nDenmark De kom for at dræbe\nFinland Kuolema kulkee lännessä\nFrance Le moment de tuer\nGreece Il Momento di Uccidere\nMexico La hora de matar\nPortugal O Momento de Matar\nSpain El momento de matar\nSweden De kom för att döda\nUSA The Moment to Kill\nWest Germany Django - Ein Sarg voll Blut\nThe Moment of Killing\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The other men help him find back bits of his past, until they arrive at a village where two warring families recognize him. - RS\n\nThe Unholy Four (1970)\nDirector: Enzo Barboni (as E.B.Clucher)\nWriters: Mario di Nardo (screenplay), Franco Rossetti (screenplay) \nStars: Leonard Mann, Woody Strode, Peter Martell\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 March 1970 USA\n\nStoryline:\nA gang of robbers sets a diversionary fire in a madhouse as part of their plot to steal a gold shipment. Four inmates escape together. One of them, an amnesiac, hopes to find out who he is and where he comes from. One of the robbers reveals his name, Chuck Mool, and other clues lead him and his fellow escapees to his hometown. There Chuck is reintroduced to his family. But then, maybe it's not his family. Written by Jim Beaver on IMDb.com \n\nReviews: \n\"Starting with the very first scene, this flawed masterpiece of pastaland gunslingin' grabs your attention and keeps it locked in until the final, intricately choreographed shootout.\n\nWhen some bank robbers set fire to the local nut-house to create a diversion, four inmates manage to escape and take in on the run. One is an amnesiac who is searching for his identity and in the process the four find themselves on the trail of the bank robbers. The trail leads to a town where Chuck Mool's family is located, but who are they? And why is everyone in town deathly afraid of him?\n\nThe plot outline may not sound like much but this top-notch spag is excellently made with great camerawork, a well written script, exciting, intricately choreographed action and hell, even the costumes and sets are done with style.\n\nIt's not just plot that makes a classic spag, but character bits, atmosphere and action, and this one's got it in spades. One of the more amusing character moments is when Eastman finds Strode in the local church cheerfully playing the organ and singing hymns while an exhausted preacher, in fear of his life, is madly pumping the instrument.\n\nFrom blazing infernos and barroom brawls to cat n' mouse gunfights in dark cemeteries this one is a winner from the first frame. Too bad nobody seems to know about it.\" Written by Junkie-6 on IMDb.com\n\n\"The script for this revenge western manages to avoid most pitfalls that threaten most run of the mill productions of the genre. The story of four men, escaped from a lunatic asylum, helping a friend of theirs to revenge himself on the man who almost killed him gives room to the usual nonsensical duels and shootouts. It is here, however, that truly inspired camerawork leaves us breathless. The antics of the four men bring a healthy dose of humor and diversity to the script and director Enzo Carboni knows how to bring out their different characters. As is often the case, an American actor is hired to make the film more attractive for the US market. Gun for hire this time around is Woody Strode, who visibly has a lot of fun playing the simple but loyal brute. A hugely enjoyable spaghetti western, then, from the man who brought us the Trinity films starring Terence Hill.\" Written by libertyvalance on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Ciakmull - L'uomo della vendetta\nBelgium (French title): Le batard de Dodge City\nBrazil: Chuck Mull, O Homem da Vingança\nBrazil (reissue title): Ciakmull, O Homem da Vingança\nDenmark: Bastarden fra Dodge City\nFinland: Kostaja\nFrance: Ciakmull, le bâtard de Dodge City\nGreece (transliterated title): Ta 4 pistolia tou Vorra\nGreece (video title): Ciak Mull, o ekdikitis\nIreland (English title): The Unholy Four\nPortugal: O Homem da Vingança\nSpain: La puerta del infierno\nSpain (alternative title): Ciak Mull (Puerta abierta al infierno)\nSpain (alternative title): Ciak Mull: Vengador sin piedad\nSpain (alternative title): Puerta abierta al infierno\nSweden: 4 vilda män\nTurkey (Turkish title): Batının 4 devi\nUK: The Unholy Four\nUSA: Chuck Moll\nUSA: The Unholy Four\nWest Germany: Django - Die Nacht der langen Messer\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Spaghetti Western starring Ken Clark : The Road to Fort Alamo - A lone rider comes across a dying soldier, who gives him a paper authorizing the payment of $150,000 to the U.S. Army. The rider gathers some colleagues who disguise themselves as soldiers and who take the paper to a bank.\n\nThe Road to Fort Alamo (1964)\nDirector: Mario Bava (as John Old)\nWriters: Lorenzo Gicca Palli (screenplay) (as Vincent Thomas), Francesco Prosperi (screenplay) \nStars: Ken Clark, Jany Clair, Michel Lemoine \nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy | France\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 8 October 1965 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Arizona Bill \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nA lone rider comes across a dying soldier, the victim of an Indian attack, who gives him a paper authorizing the payment of $150,000 to the U.S. Army. The rider gathers some colleagues who disguise themselves as soldiers and who take the paper to a bank. They get the money but a shoot-out occurs, an old woman is killed, and the gang acrimoniously splits up. Later some members of the gang meet up with some real U.S. Cavalry soldiers and together they must fight off new Indian attacks.\n\nReviews:\n\"THE ROAD TO FORT ALAMO is the first spaghetti western directed by Italian genre maestro Mario Bava, but as a film made in 1964 it has more in common with the American westerns of the 1950s than the Sergio Leone-influenced genre films of the late 1960s onwards. The film itself is routinely plotted but turns out to be a lot of fun regardless, with an action-heavy template meaning that there's barely a slow moment to be had throughout.\n\nThe film's protagonist is played by the strapping Ken Clark, a familiar face from the Eurospy films he made during the mid 1960s. He's massive here, dwarfing his opponents in the various fight scenes, and he acquits himself well with the material, having a natural flair for the genre. He reminded me of Richard Harrison in many ways. His character undergoes quite the journey in this film, with many plot twists, double crosses, and betrayals en route.\n\nThe film's antagonists are the usual bunch of murderous Native Americans and gold-hungry double-crossers. There's plenty going on throughout and the film, which was shot in Italy rather than Spain, looks very nice. Bava's skill comes in the night-time scenes which have the great use of colour that the director is well noted for. THE ROAD TO FORT ALAMO might not be a classic, but as a serviceable spagwest it works a treat.\" Written by Leofwine_draca on IMDb.com \n\n\"La strada per Fort Alamo\" was shot in Italy, not in Spain like most Italian westerns. Director \"John Old\" alias Mario Bava was obviously influenced by the John Ford classics such as \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon\", all just in a much cheaper B-movie style; it has almost nothing in common with the typical \"Django pays for your funeral\" kind of western. This movie has a good script with good dialogs; it's about a bandit who has to pose as an army officer after he got caught wearing a stolen uniform. When Indians attack, he gets opportunity to show he is a brave good guy. One word to the disappointed Bava fans: surely the master had to earn a living, too, and this is what he did for it. You don't shoot masterpieces like \"Danger: Diabolik\" or \"Mask of Satan\" every week. More important than such comparisons is that \"La strada per Fort Alamo\" is a good quality western in a traditional way, and if you don't expect more than that, it's well worth watching.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) La strada per Forte Alamo\nBelgium (French title) (video title) Il était une fois la mort\nCanada (French title) Arizona Bill\nFrance Arizona Bill\nGreece La Strada per Forte Alamo\nSpain (orthographically correct title) Camino del fuerte Alamo\nUSA The Road to Fort Alamo\nWest Germany Der Ritt nach Alamo\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Return of Sabata - Hobsonville's citizens hire a gunslinger to rid them of the McIntock clan that is forcibly and unlawfully taxing the townsfolk under the pretext of town development. \n\nReturn of Sabata (1971)\nDirector: Gianfranco Parolini (as Frank Kramer)\nWriters: Renato Izzo (screenplay), Gianfranco Parolini (screenplay)\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, Reiner Schöne, Giampiero Albertini \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | France | West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 18 May 1972 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Return of Sabata\nFilming Locations: Elios Film Studios\n\nStoryline:\nMaster gunslinger Sabata arrives in Hobsonville, a town completely owned by McIntock, a robber baron who is taxing the inhabitants for the cost of future improvements to the town. Or that's what McIntock says he'll do with the money...\n\nReviews:\n\"This has to be one of the most entertaining, funniest and fun to watch movies I've seen in a while! As a lover of spaghetti westerns and a big fan of Lee van Cleef, I was excited about catching this on TV. Not the kind of movie you have the chance to watch usually, at least where I live. I expected just one more SW, but no -\"É tornato Sabata\" offers something more. It is quirky, it is sometimes bordering the realms of surreal; and it's a lot of fun to watch. But funny, also -in fact, it's something of a comedy-western, with the agreeable bit of cheesiness that you can find in some of these movies -movies made only to entertain people and provide a good time. This movie does that not only by way of the plot -the charismatic and mysterious hero Sabata arrives in a town ruled by a local tyrant who imposes abusive taxes, with the action that ensues- but also and especially thanks to the amusing dialogues and performances of the whole cast, of which I especially enjoyed Lee van Cleef -once again showing what a talented, sadly underrated actor he was, but also how much he enjoyed his work-, and Pedro Sánchez, here listed as Ignazio Spalla.\n\nGianfranco Parolini directs the movie, paying very good attention to most of the unwritten rules or principles of spaghetti westerns, following Sergio Leone's extreme close-ups or sometimes slightly overdone facial expressions or sound effects.\n\nGoing back to the plot, I have to add that it contains enough fun and clever twists to be quite original and worth watching closely.\" Written by Agnelin on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): È tornato Sabata... hai chiuso un'altra volta!\nAustralia: The Return of Sabata\nAustria (alternative title): Sabata kehrt zurück\nBrazil (reissue title): O Retorno de Sabata\nBrazil (TV title): A Volta de Sabata\nBrazil: Sabata Vem para Vingar\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Завръщането на Сабата\nCanada (English title): Return of Sabata\nCzechoslovakia: Návrat Sabaty\nDenmark: Sabata vender tilbage\nEurope (English title) (informal English title): Return of Sabata\nFinland: Sabatan paluu\nFrance: Le retour de Sabata\nGreece (transliterated title): I epistrofi tou Sabata\nHong Kong (Mandarin title): Yi dai chang wang sha ji\nHungary: Isten veled, Sabata\nHungary (alternative title): Sabata visszatér\nJapan (Japanese title): 西部決闘史\nNetherlands (Dutch title): Return of sabata\nNorway: Men Sabata var ikke død\nPoland: Powrót Sabaty\nPortugal: O Regresso de Sabata\nRomania: Sabata se întoarce\nSerbia: Heroj crnog kolta\nSlovenia: Junak črnega kolta\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Возвращение Сабаты\nSoviet Union (Russian title) (transliterated title): Vozvrashcheniye Sabaty\nSpain: Texas, 1870\nSpain (Catalan title): El retorn de Sabata\nSweden: Sabatas återkomst\nTurkey (Turkish title): Sabata dönüyor\nUkraine: Повернення Сабати\nUK: Return of Sabata\nUSA (DVD title): Return of Sabata\nWest Germany (working title): Die Rückkehr von Sabata\nWest Germany: Sabata kehrt zurück\nWorld-wide (English title): Return of Sabata\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Povratak Sabate\nYugoslavia (Slovenian title): Junak črnega kolta\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): Heroj crnog kolta\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Fasthand - Spaghetti Western - A gang of former confederates lay siege to a Cavalry fort. \n\nFasthand (1973)\nDirector: Mario Bianchi (as Frank Bronston)\nWriters: Alberto Cardone, Eduardo Manzanos (as Eduardo Manzanos Brochero) \nStars: Sergio Ciani, William Berger, Frank Braña\nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 August 1974 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Fast Hand Is Still My Name \nFilming Locations: Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nThe Civil War has ended, but the fighting hasn’t out West. Bands of ex-Rebel soldiers are still terrorizing the countryside.\n\nCapt. Jeff Madison (Alan Steel) is on one of the best at bringing those renegades to justice.\n\nNow he’s on the trail of one of the most notorious, Machedo (William Berger).\n\nMachedo’s men set an ambush for Madison; only he and a sergeant survive. They return to Fort Mason, to find Machedo’s men have captured it as well.\n\nMadison flees, but is caught. Rather than putting him to death, Machedo has him staked out, fires two bullets into his gun hand, and then leaves him for dead.\n\nOnly Madison doesn’t die. Though his gun hand is permanently crippled, he’s rescued by Indians, including a pretty maiden named Swanna.\n\nTwo years later, when Machedo’s men steal a small fortune in gold coins from a bank, Madison returns.\n\nFirst, he hijacks the hearse being used to sneak the gold out of town. Then he hides the gold in a ghost town called Blackston Hill in order to lure Machedo and his gang there to dole out his revenge.\n\nBut the odds will be long. Especially for a man who isn’t the gunman he once was. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\n\"This movie was made in 1972, but seems more like it came from the mid to late 60's when spaghetti westerns generally had a more serious tone.\n\nIt is a typical but very good revenge tale about an ex-union officer whose hand was crippled by an ex-confederate who leads a band of guerrillas who continue to terrorize people after the war is over. It's fun to watch as the now clad-in-black hero seems to come back from the dead, and hunts down and kills his enemies one by one.\n\nSergio Ciani plays the protagonist in a performance that is horrible even by spaghetti western standards. In all fairness though, there may be another person dubbing his voice who can be blamed in whole or in part for the wooden performance. I don't know, but it's pretty bad. Fortunately, William Berger makes up for it. He is excellent in the role of Machedo, the leader of the confederate gang. This is definitely Berger's movie. It's probably the best performance I've seen from him.\n\nThe music score by Ferrio is also very good.\n\nIf you are into Euro-westerns, this ones worth checking out.\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"FAST HAND IS STILL MY NAME is a suitably gritty spaghetti western starring a former peplum star in the title role. Said actor is none other than Alan Steel, here scrawnier and more aged, but still cutting a dash as a tortured soldier who is attacked and forced to witness a massacre perpetrated by a gang of cut-throats. The story subsequently follows a revenge narrative as Steel heads on a path of violent justice to bring those responsible to book. Mario Bianchi's story is sufficiently bloody and shocking to work; it's not one of the most memorable spaghetti westerns in existence, but it does the job ably enough. The excellent supporting cast includes genre regulars Frank Brana and William Berger as members of the aforementioned bandit gang\" Written by Leofwine-Draca on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Mi chiamavano 'Requiescat'... ma avevano sbagliato\nFinland: Minä olen nopein, Mulligan\nFrance: Le rescapé de la vallée de la mort\nFrance (alternative title): Requiem pour un tueur\nGreece (video title): To grigoro pistoli\nNorway (video title): Mulligan\nSpain: Mano rápida\nUSA: Fasthand\nWest Germany: Sing mir das Lied der Rache\nWorld-wide (English title) (video title): Fast Hand Is Still My Name\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Arizona Colt, declining to do either, heads for Blackstone City where Gordo is planning a robbery. When one of Gordon's men murders saloon girl Dolores, Arizona offers to hunt down the killer for the price of five hundred Dollars and Dolores' sister, Jane.\" Written by Tom Seldon on IMDb.com\n\nReview: \n\"The Man From Nowhere aka Arizona Colt is a spaghetti western with solid performances from a great cast. The main players are Giuliano Gemma and Fernando Sancho, both of whom are great in this film, as always. Sancho, always the villain, is even more ruthless than usual in this outing. The lovely Rosalba Neri, another familiar spaghetti western face, also makes an appearance in the movie.\n\nGemma, as Arizona Colt, can be likened to Bugs Bunny having some fun being the foil to Fernando Sancho and his gang of Elmer Fudds, but that doesn't make this a comedy western by any means. While there are many amusing parts, the body count is high, and there is a strong element of revenge.\n\nThe music score is very good, with lots of spaghetti style, and the movie is filmed and directed well. The story takes some time to pull you in, but it does, and it is a good one.\n\nI am giving this one 7 stars mainly because I don't think it is as good as Gemma's Ringo movies, but that having been said, I still highly recommend this film. It has a lot going for it.\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com \n\n\"Released on DVD here in the states as \"The Man From Nowhere\", this entry into the Western All'Italiana oeuvre features pretty boy Guiliano Gemma as the good, veteran character actor Fernando Sancho as the bad, and a disappointing script as the ugly.\n\nArizona Colt can never quite figure out what it's trying to be. As a Hollywood western there would have been a few too many deaths and too strong a focus on destruction. As an Italian Western it takes itself too seriously and leans too heavily on wide tracking shots of the ol' west.\n\nThere is some good humor, and the reveal how Arizona is going to take on a town full of baddies is very slick, but this movie is a series of good moments and an overall weak effort when considered as a whole.\" Written by cwhaskell on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) Arizona Colt\nBrazil Arizona Colt\nCanada (English title) Man from Nowhere\nColombia Arizona Colt\nDenmark 50.000 Dollars for Arizona Colt\nFrance Arizona Colt\nGreece Arizona Colt\nHong Kong (Cantonese title) Faai cheung sau gong wu fu baa\nJapan (Japanese title) 南から来た用心棒\nPortugal Arizona Colt\nSpain Arizona Colt\nSweden 50.000 dollar för Arizona Colt\nTaiwan 江湖奇士續集\nTurkey (Turkish title) Gringo Arizona'da\nUK Arizona Colt\nUSA (English title) Man from Nowhere\nUSA Arizona Colt\nWest Germany (video title) Halleluja Companeros\nWest Germany Arizona Colt\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) Arizona Kolt osvetnik\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

A gunslinger arrives and decides to help the citizens take their community back, but the gang refuses to give up easily. \n\nReviews:\n\"The movie gets Western action , shootouts , a love story , thrills and results to be quite entertaining . Set in 1895 , when a group of outlaws take over a small frontier town called Dakota . This is a tale of fear , greed and murder , set in a little town where happens a lot of incidents and shootouts . There bandits and rustlers plan to stay awhile, as they carry out robbing , assaults to win money at whatever cost by means of crime and terror . These outlaws called Reno (Sieghardt Rupp) and Gringo (Daniel Martín) are undercoveringly hired by a corrupt lawyer named Ken Denton (Helmut Schmid) . As the nasty gang (Rupp and Martin , both of them played in ¨For a fistful of dollars) assault a stagecoach and kill the mines owner called Walton (Pietro Tordi) , whose daughter to take the ownership of the transport company . Moreover , villainous Ken Denton wishes to take her business . In the meantime , a gunslinger called Mace Carson (Götz George) arrives and decides to help the citizens take their community back , as he is appointed sheriff but the band refuses to give up easily.\n\nEntertaining Chorizo/Schnitzel Western well produced by Alfons Carcasona with shoot'em up , action , violence , go riding , saloon brawls and amusement . It is a passable Western with a lot of surprises , thrills and including a love story between a drifter become a sheriff , Gotz George , and a beautiful owner , Alexandra Stewart . This film , realized in American Western style and no Spaghetti , contains Western-action , gun-play , fist-play and being enough amusing but mediocre . This Spanish/German western , probably won't be making too many top ten lists, but its an agreeable flick . It's a thrilling western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts an avaricious advocate at law played by Helmut Schmid , including breathtaking crossfire between protagonists when are besieged at a ranch against the enemies during the ending . It's a medium budget film with good actors , technicians , production values , pleasing results and turned to be shot entirely on location . Here filmmaker Roy Rowland delivers a decently-paced film , however he could be counted on to deliver solid \"B\" pictures which, at MGM , were often better than most other studios' . It's a stirring western with breathtaking gunfight between the brave protagonist Gotz George against the heartless Helmut Schmid and his nasty hoodlums : Daniel Martin and Rupp . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . Most players result to be too clean to compare with Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name', so the result is nothing particular: too pretty for grit, too gritty for a traditional B and even a script co-written by Clark Reynolds can't do much . The film blends violence , thrills , high body-count and it's fast moving and exciting .

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Coffin Full of Dollars - Spaghetti Western - There's a frontier feud on the border of Mexico. Outlaw Hagen's brothers have been killed by Nevada's Kid's family. \n\nCoffin Full of Dollars (1971)\nDirector: Demofilo Fidani (as Miles Deem)\nWriters: Demofilo Fidani (screenplay), Alfredo Medori (dialogue) \nStars: Jack Betts, Gordon Mitchell, Ray Saunders\nGenres: Western | Action \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: Italian\nRelease Date: 7 January 1972 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: A Barrel Full of Dollars \nFilming Locations: Elios Film, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nThere's a frontier feud on the border of Mexico. Outlaw Hagen's brothers have been killed by Nevada's Kid's family.\n\nReviews:\n\"Hagen (Klaus Kinski, or \"Slander\" in my dubbed version) burns down the farm of the Hamiltons and kills the whole family - except one who was absent and swears revenge upon his return. Nevada Kid (Jeff Cameron) gets unexpected support from a bounty hunter (Gordon Mitchell) who carries a list of all wanted men - which has the size of a big city's telephone registry. They rescue a maiden in distress (played by Simone Blondell, the daughter of director Fidani) and happily kill everybody who looks like a bandit.\n\nTruly no art, but still the best movie by the director, as far as I've seen his works... which reviewers often describe as \"junk\". The screenplay is straight ahead, the music by Lallo Gori provides tension and a good title song, and the camera work of Joe D'Amato is excellent with its many close-ups and precise focusing. Kinski puts more effort in his performance than in some other westerns, for example in the scene at the beginning when he discovers his two brothers were killed. Ray Saunders got a really nice role as a former slave saved by Nevada Kid. In a scene which was cut from the 80s video tape version but restored for DVD, he even sings a song. Hunt Powers is first mentioned in the cast, but plays only one of the bandits.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\n\"I'm not a huge fan of Demofilo Fidani, but I think this is his best, and I'm writing this mainly to refute the rubbish in some of the other reviews of this one that I've seen.\n\nCan you imagine someone watching an Ed Wood movie, because it's an Ed Wood movie, and complaining about the sets being cheap??? That's pretty much what I'm seeing, absurd as it is. That and people that don't know anything about the genre. Hey, people, Spaghetti Westerns existed before that useless twerp Tarantino decided to rip them off. He ripped off the blood squibs and such from Hong Kong action cinema, not from SWs. They've never been big into that. Hand waving is good when you're doing it deliberately and you know you are. It's irritating when it's supposed to work as logic, but when you just want to say, \"and then that happens\" it works in a B movie. Klaus Kinski is great as ever.\n\nSimonetta Vitelli (as Simone Blondell) has to be one of the most gorgeous women that has ever walked the planet. Cheap shots about her looks??? Definitely from someone whose taste is limited to their lingual epithelium.\" Written by adrianswingler on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Per una bara piena di dollari\nBrazil: Por um Caixão Cheio de Dólares\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): За един ковчег, пълен с долари\nFinland (video box title): Kirstullinen dollareita\nFinland (video title): Arkku täynnä dollareita.\nFrance: Nevada Kid\nGreece (transliterated title): Ena feretro femato dollaria\nGreece (video title): Nevada Kid\nGreece:  Ένα φέρετρο γεμάτο δολλάρια\nSpain: Nevada Kid\nSweden (theatrical title): Nevada Kid\nSweden (video title): En kista full med dollar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Teks-Gece kartalı\nUK: Coffin Full of Dollars\nUSA: Coffin Full of Dollars\nUSA: Nevada Kid\nUSA: Showdown for a Badman\nWest Germany: Adios Companeros\nWest Germany (DVD title): Für einen Sarg voller Dollars\n A Barrel Full of Dollars\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Beyond Hatred - A family of pioneers is almost completely destroyed by Indians in search of revenge: Little George was left fainted on the ground, and his small sister adopted by the Indian chief. Fate will bring them together again.\n\nBeyond Hatred (1972)\nDirector: Alessandro Santini\nWriter: Bruno Vani\nStars: Stefania Nelli, Jeff Cameron, George Cavendish\nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 19 March 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Au-delà de la haine \n\nStoryline:\nA frontier family is celebrating the return of a gift-bearing father when the Indians attack, killing everyone but the young daughter they carry off as a captive.\n\nFlash forward several years, and hostilities between the whites and the Indians are still raging, with members of the Arikara tribe determined to go on the warpath to make the whites pay for a recent massacre.\n\nKite (Jeff Cameron) will have the privilege of leading the Arikara warriors into battle, though his pretty lover Loana (Stefania Nelli) has premonitions that all might not end well.\n\nNevertheless, Kite and his men ambush a cavalry caravan, making off with a large supply of guns and two captive troopers, one of whom is badly wounded.\n\nLoana sneaks into the teepee where the prisoners are being held one night, intent on killing that captive. Until she notices the necklace around his neck. It’s identical to one she’s worn most of her life.\n\nThen the memories of that long-ago attack on the frontier family come flooding back. She was the young girl captured; the wounded soldier is the brother she presumed was dead.\n\nMeanwhile, spurred into action by the attack on the caravan, Col. Manson vows to annihilate the Indians and bring peace to the frontier once and for all.  Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\n\"Mostly spaghetti western often was underpinned for bizarre characters and far-fetched story, this minor movie starts in these old concepts, a massive blowouts in opening is quite contrived, exposing a decoy at first sight, soon the movie became a slow paced action, interesting that the mains characters weren't a white men usually, overral the plot is focused in the brave young Indian warrior Running Deer (Jeff Cameron), the plot starts with a settler's family who were killed by a Indian raid, just survives a boy and the girl was kidnapped by the natives and raised by Black Cloud the Chief, later already a girl Loana (Stefania Nelli) was promised to marry with Running Deer, meanwhile the tensions grows up between the Calvary and the Indians stuck in a small reservation, actually the Loana's brother serves the US's Army, after a battle against the Indians he was catch and stays a little while recovering at Indians's tribe, Loana finds in his neck the same collar that she had, then he realizes that man possibly is your brother, seems simple and usual, but has some qualities, the final is plenty acceptable, actually an anti-war movie, not so bad as described by the above reviewer!!!\" Written by elo-equipamentos on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Al di là dell'odio\nFrance: Au-delà de la haine\nUSA: Beyond the Frontiers of Hate\nWorld-wide (English title) (video title): Beyond Hatred\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westerns #grjngo #spaghettiwestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Once he has paid his whole penalty, he decides to go and get back both his son and his hidden loot: $200,000 from a bank robbery.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is a semi-¨Zapata¨ Western plenty of Gunplay and revenge along with a fraternal story . Spaghetti and Chorizo Western , co-produced between Spain and Italy and starred by two ordinary Spaghetti actors as the Italian Guglielmo Spoletini as William Bogart and the Spanish Eduardo Fajardo dealing with a real and violent confrontation . This is not an ordinary oater outing , it's a Spaghetti with Paella Western crammed with action , shootouts , lots of violence and a thought-provoking as well as sensitive story . The film follows the American Western models but also in Spaghetti style . An Italian-Spanish co-production with outdoor sequences filmed in Colmenar Viejo , La Pedriza and Manzanares Del Real , Madrid , and , Almeria , of course . Concerning Martin Rojas (Guglielmo Spoletini as William Bogart) is a poor Mexican peasant whose home is destroyed by nasty American homesteaders ; after that , he and his unhappy partners (Fernando Sánchez Pollack) are forced to abandon their lands and flee to Mexico after they kill some cutthroats . Rojas and his bunch of Mexican people become bandits and helped by Trevor organize a big bank holdup run by a banker (Miguel Del Castillo) . Rojas , now nicknamed ¨El Lobo (Wolf) De Sierrablanca¨ forms a band of outlaws which raids the border , trying to gain back some of what they have lost , assaulting banks and robbing . But Rojas's spouse (Pilar Cansino) dies in childbirth . Soon after , Rojas is pursued by a sheriff (Sydney Chaplin) and a posse who goes into Mexican territory , being captured and condemned for 20 years in prison . Meanwhile , the sheriff and his wife (Agnes Spaak , top-billed in spite of a brief acting) adopt the kid . Ten years later , Rojas embarks on his vendetta and getaways from jail to see his little boy . And during his quest he carries the revenge in his heart after seeing his unknown son . An old colleague of his heists called Trevor (Eduardo Fajardo) is after a fortune in gold that Rojas had hidden . Rojas finds himself a danger when his son is kidnapped by Trevor . He gets stuck his son and both of whom escape and lost in the sunny desert . Rojas is looking for vengeance of his former partner who doublé-crossed him .\n\nIt's full of action , exaggerated characters , shootouts , loads of violence , but also displays an exciting and nicely developed screenplay , full of thrilling as well as interesting and sentimental events . It's a medium budget film with usual actors , good technicians, passable production values and acceptable results . A better than average Western regarding a revenge story , with plenty of violence ,shoot'em up , thrills and noisy action. \"Death Knows No Time\" or \"Tierra Brava\" or ¨Pagó Cara su Muerte¨ is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist , an unlucky countryman become a gunslinger who is forced to make a fundamental choice about his life , against his relentless enemies .\" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Pagó cara su muerte\nBrazil: Em Torno Dele Rondava a Morte\nGreece (transliterated title): Tierra brava\nItaly: ...E intorno a lui fu morte\nUSA: Death Knows No Time\nUSA: Tierra Brava\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The city prepares fifteen gallows, believing their harsh, cruel Sheriff will manage to do it. The two gang leaders unite, many men fall in gunfights, three women are murdered, but the end is a surprise to all.\n\nReviews:\n\"An Italian-Spanish co-production full of action , exaggerated characters, shootouts and loads of violence . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . There's also an interesting intrigue and whodunit with some Giallo when happens a killing spree , and the question is : Who is the killer ? For money, for pleasure, for revenge, he doesn't care why he kills or how ¡ . A family formed by a mother (Margarita Lozano) and two daughters (Eleonora Brown) is cruelly killed and are accused two different bands who are facing each other . One gang (Jose Canalejas) is led by Billy Mack (Graig Hill) and another one (Frank Braña) is commanded by Sandy Cassel (George Martin) . When the fiancé named Bud Lee (Howard Ross) of a murdered girl learns the slaughter and atrocity committed he executes a single-handedly revenge , ravages and kills each person involved in the massacre . Bud is relentless in his vendetta , deadly in his violence . Then the two bands flee and go to the town which is inhabited by important people as the Sheriff ( Antonio Molino Rojo) , the banker , the priest (Andrea Bosic), the doctor (Umberto Raho) and a gorgeous Pastor's priest named Barbara Ferguson (Susy Andersen) , among others . But Barbara is kidnapped as hostage and the bandits get away to Mexico . They arrive in a Mexican village but are besieged by a posse (Antonio Molino , Aldo Sambrell , Alvaro De Luna) formed to chase them . There takes place violent fights , facing off , hangings and final surprise about the killer's identity .\n\nIt's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Graig Hill and George Martin and his hoodlums . Both of whom are fine , they ravage the screen, kill , shoot , hit and run , besides receive violent punches, kicks and hitting . Aldo Sambrell as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, he subsequently would play very secondary or minimum characters . Furthermore, there appears usual Italian/Spanish Western secondaries as Alvaro De Luna, Rafael Albaicin, Jose Canalejas , Antonio Molino Rojo , Ricardo Palacios , Jose Luis Martin and of course Frank Braña . The film blends violence , blood , tension , high body-count and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the final gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion. \" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 15 forche per un assassino\nBrazil: 15 Forcas para um Assassino\nFrance: 15 potences pour un salopard\nFrance (alternative spelling): Quinze potences pour un salopard\nGreece (transliterated title): Dekapente aghones gia ena dolofono\nPortugal: A Um Passo da Forca\nSpain (poster title): Quince horcas para un asesino\nSpain: 15 horcas para un asesino\nUSA (alternative spelling): Fifteen Scaffolds for the Killer\nUSA: 15 Scaffolds for a Murderer\nUSA (video title): The Dirty Fifteen\nWest Germany: Die schmutzigen Dreizehn\nWest Germany (video title): Dirty Buster's\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Western movie for free: 10,000 Dollars for a Massacre - Django has become a bounty hunter who is asked to chase a villain who has kidnapped a young girl. \n\n10,000 Dollars for a Massacre (1967)\nDirector: Romolo Guerrieri\nWriters: Franco Fogagnolo (story), Ernesto Gastaldi (story) \nStars: Gianni Garko, Loredana Nusciak, Claudio Camaso  \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 8 March 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Django - 10.000 blutige Dollar \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nDjango has become a bounty hunter who is asked to chase a villain who has kidnapped a young girl. Because he is not offered enough money, he decides to join forces with the bandit but he's double-crossed by the ruthless villain.\n\nReviews:\n\"Acceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual writer Ernesto Gastaldi , splendid cinematography by Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi . It is a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios , as invincible and tough antiheroes , complex as well as fast showdowns with numerous casualties , impulsive and quick zooms , and musical score with Morricone influence . The picture has a certain remembrance to ¨For a fistful dollars more¨ (Sergio Leone) regarding the avenging theme and including Manuel character who bears remarkable resemblance to Indio role (Gian Maria Volonte) ; furthermore , Claudio Camaso was brother of Volonte and holding physical likeness and similar playing . Besides , good set decoration filmed in Elios studios and , of course , Almeria (Spain) . It also bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Django¨ (Sergio Corbucci) regarding 'the Saloon girl character' , equally interpreted by Loredana Nusciak . The highlights of the movie result to be the followings : when the hero wakes up from the beach along with a corpse , Django living in a photography back room studio decorated against posters captioning ¨Wanted : Dead or alive¨ , the phantom village full of dust and wind and Django buried until neck , among others . ¨Ten thousand dollars blood money¨ was shot at the same time to ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing (by Giovanni Fago)¨ with similar artist and technician team and also starred by Gianni Garco , Claudio Camaso and Fernando Sancho . The motion picture finely produced by Mino Loy , Luciano and Sergio Martino brothers was well directed by Romolo Guerrieri who also made other Pasta Westerns . Romolo is a good craftsman who has directed all type of genres such as post-nuke Sci-fi as ¨ The last warrior¨ , Italian crime or Poliziottesco as \"Young, Violent, Dangerous\" , ¨City under siege¨ , \"Ring of Death\" and westerns as ¨Johnny Yuma¨ and ¨Seven guns for Timothy¨ again with Fernando Sancho . Rating : Better than average Spaghetti Western .\" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 10,000 dollari per un massacro\nBrazil: 10,000 Dólares para Django\nBrazil: Django Mata por Dinheiro\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Убийство за 10 000 долара\nChile: 10000 Dólares por una masacre\nDenmark: Djangos blodhævn\nFrance: Le temps des vautours\nFrance (alternative title): 10 000 Dollars pour un massacre\nGermany (DVD title): Django - 10.000 blutige Dollar\nGreece (transliterated title): An eisai zontanos, htypa\nIreland (English title): 10,000 Dollars Blood Money\nItaly (working title): 7 dollari su Django\nJapan: Nihiki no nagarebosi\nJapan (Japanese title): 二匹の流れ星\nNetherlands: 10.000 Dollar Bloedgeld\nNorway: 10.000 Dollars død eller levende!\nPortugal: 10.000 Dólares para um Massacre\nSpain: Como lobos sedientos\nSpain (pre-release title): 10.000 dólares por un masacro\nSweden: 10.000 dollar - död eller levande\nUK (alternative title): Guns of Violence\nUK: $10,000 Blood Money\nUSA: 10,000 Dollars for a Massacre\nUSA (alternative spelling): Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre\nWest Germany: 10.000 blutige Dollar\nWest Germany: Zehntausend blutige Dollar\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): 10 000 dolara za masakr\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Savage Guns - A cruel and ruthless bandit kills a tavern owner who had ratted him out to the authorities.\n \nSavage Guns (1971)\nDirector: Demofilo Fidani (as Miles Deem)\nWriters: Demofilo Fidani (as Miles Deem), Mila Vitelli Valenza (as Mila Vitelli)\nStars: Robert Woods, Dino Strano, Benito Pacifico \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 4 February 1976 (France) \nAlso Known As: His Name Was Sam Walbash, But They Call Him Amen \n\nStoryline:\nA cruel and ruthless bandit kills a tavern owner who had ratted him out to the authorities. Sam Wallbush witnesses the murder, as well as the murder of his brother who happens to get in the way of the bandit. Sam swears revenge and sets out for blood. \n\nReviews:\n\"This is a very quirky film. It is, at times, unintentionally funny, and at other times just plain bizarre, but hey I like that kind of stuff so it's alright with me. I actually find this film to be extremely entertaining. Of the four or five Demofilo Fidani movies I have seen, this one is the best.\n\nThe music score by Lallo Gori is excellent. It is probably the highest-quality part of the movie. The trumpets, guitar, and organ are used skillfully to create suspense and emotion with a style that is undeniably spaghetti western.\n\nThough Fidani's movies are not known for good acting, Robert Woods actually does a pretty good job in this one as Sam Wallach, the slightly whacked protagonist who suffers from dooraphobia (Yes, he breaks out in a cold sweat and gets hysterical at the mere thought of a door opening and closing. I'm not making this up!) Simonetta Vitelli is also good as Fanny the barmaid. I can't think of any other Fidani film that actually has TWO halfway decent acting performances.\n\nI noticed that another reviewer has commented that the movie seems out of order and makes no sense. Actually, there is a plot here and it's not all that hard to follow. The order of events seems correct to me. It is a simple revenge tale. It's a rather typical story, but a pretty decent one. It also has more action than the other Fidani westerns I have seen. Perhaps my copy is a more complete version than some of the others out there. I'm not sure. It's 85 min. long.\n\nThe movie's got some corny dialog, but that just makes for more laughs, which is a good thing. I suspect it's because the English translation is poorly done, but who knows?\n\nSome strange highlights of the film include a surreal, slow-motion brawl with echoing sound and laughter, an odd conversation between the main villain and his gang where he orders them to split up to avoid capture but doesn't mind when they refuse to leave, a way over-the-top cheesy slow-motion flashback sequence, Sam's dooraphobia, of course, and a French female barroom singer whose accent seems more German than French. She sounds like she has a microphone, and sings in a style that sounds more like it's from the 1930's than the 1870's.\n\nYou either love this kind of stuff or you don't. Like I said before, I find it very entertaining. I'd rather watch this one than many of the so-called \"great\" films. It sure beats the hell out of trying to sit through \"Gone With the Wind.\" Yuck!\" Written by spider89118 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): Era Sam Wallash!... lo chiamavano...

When Tracy kidnaps and blackmails his former employer Kitosch redeems himself by saving them. \n\nLast of the Badmen (1967)\nDirector: Nando Cicero\nWriters: Fulvio Gicca Palli (story) (as Fulvio Gicca), Fulvio Gicca Palli (screenplay) (as Fulvio Gicca)\nStars: George Hilton, Frank Wolff, Pamela Tudor\nGenre: Western\nRuntime: 1h 35min\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: Italian\nOriginal title: Il tempo degli avvoltoi \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\n\nKitosch is charged with a crime he did not commit and joins up with Joshua Tracy, a vicious outlaw. When Tracy kidnaps and blackmails his former employer Kitosch redeems himself by saving them.\n\nUser Reviews:\n\n''A right little stormer of a western, marked out by a good showing from George Hilton in the title role and a show stealing performance from the wonderful Frank Wolff as the villain \"Black Tracy\". Hilton plays Kitosch, who his mocked and abused by his ranch hand workmates, but its not long before he turns the tables and runs riot with the demented Wolff. Along the way there is revenge, robbery, betrayal and just about everything a good western should have. At the end of the day its Wolffs show, and what a show he gives.'' Written by Cranstonman on IMDb.\n\n''Last of the Badmen is one of the best spaghetti-westerns I have ever seen. The description is not too difficult: Extremely cruel and sadistic italowestern, with cynicism brought on film length. George Hilton in one of his best performances. His role sways between a drunken ruffian, an aggressive revolver hero and a complete bastard. He plays Kitosch (a quite unusual name for a gunman), a cattle guardian at Don Jaimes (Eduardo Fajardo) ranch. When Kitosch is discovered with Don Jaimes wife (Pamela Tudor), he gets brand like an animal. But he succeeds in escaping. With the arrival in the next small town he tries to ask the sheriff for protection, because Don Jaime has put his men on Kitosch. However, instead of getting help, he is arrested and locked up to be delivered to Don Jaimes men. At this moment the hangdog Joshua Tracy (Frank Wolff), who is searched with the warrant of apprehension, appears. He kills the sheriff and his assistant and releases Kitosch. Together they are an unbeatable team. What do 2 criminals do? Clear, they commit crime. However, soon it turns out that Tracy isn't that cool like he appeared at the beginning. One could say, he is the perfect example of the devil. His preoccupation is to take revenge at his ex-wife and her new lover Big John. After Tracy has burned his former girlfriend, he is keen on killing Big John. Kitosch tries to repair the ill, aggressive impulses of his friend, however, only with little success. Finally, they want to visit Don Jaime and settle accounts with him, however, among them it comes more and more to differences... \" The time of vultures \" is a film with very good theatrical achievements of the principal characters and acts from the problems of human beings and morally questionable traits. George Hilton is convincing. In fact, Frank Wolff plays an unusual, unsympathetic role. But he is the one, who gives us a wonderful, show-stealing performance.''

His handsome looks faded by time, drink, and possible lung cancer, Robert Taylor presents a depressing lifeless figure in this 3rd rate South American produced Western. As a big fan of Taylor, I really don't want to remember him in this film. Of course, this is easy to do, as this movie has virtually been lost to time. It's clear that Robert Taylor didn't have his heart in the role of \"Captain Martin\". He looks weather beaten, tired, and just plain worn out. His build is just too thin and he appears in ill health. Even the feel of this whole movie is that of people \"Beaten-Up\" by the passing of time and hard living.

        "Description": "Day of Anger - A scruffy garbage boy becomes the pupil of a famed gunfighter.\n\nDay Of Anger (1967):\nDirector: Tonino Valerii\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi, Tonino Valerii\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, Giuliano Gemma, Walter Rilla\nGenres: Action, Western\nRuntime: 1h 26Min\nCountry: Italy | West Germany\nLanguage: Italian | English\nRelease Date: November 1969 (USA)\nAlso Known As: Days of Wrath\nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\n\nAmiable, unassertive Scott Mary picks up the trash, cleans the toilets, sweeps the floors in the town of Clifton. Then a gunfighter comes to town. He offers advice and guidance to Scott who quickly begins to toughen and mature, thus upsetting the balance of power in the town. Written by dinky-4 of Minneapolis.\n\nReview:\n\nReally good, from the languorous, elegiac opening to the full throttle finish, I enjoyed it all. I note that IMDb shows a running time of 95 minutes whilst my new Arrow DVD runs nearer 115. Can that be so, 20 minutes cut from the previous print? It is just possible for there is a surprisingly large amount of time given to introduction of the characters and the town so that we might become totally involved. Goodness knows what anyone would make of much of this film without the precious opening ten minutes where Giuliano Gemma is introduced to us, literally as a sh*t shoveler before coming under the wing of the majestic Lee van Cleef. The famous Almeria set and surrounds plays its part well too and whilst the tale is fairly simple (revenge!) it is so well told and whilst the opening scenes seem to show a ghost town by the end we have seen it teeming with folks from all around. A fine film with much violence.

        "Description": "Death Rides a Horse (1968): Spaghetti Western, Full Length, HD, Free Western Movie, English, Wild West, Cowboy, Lee Van Cleef Western.\n\nDirector: Giulio Petroni\nWriter: Luciano Vincenzoni (script)\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, John Phillip Law, Mario Brega \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 8 March 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Von Mann zu Mann \nFilming Locations: La Calahorra, Granada, Andalucía, Spain \n\nA young gunfighter plans to track down and eliminate the bandits who killed his family, and forms a tenuous alliance with an aging ex-outlaw to achieve this end.\n\nBefore his very eyes, a young boy watches the cutthroats of a small g*ng raid his humble home, r*pe and slaughter his whole family. Fifteen years later, Bill Meceita, the once-helpless boy and the sole survivor of the massacre, has now become a cool and skilful sharpshooter, seeking revenge against the band of unknown killers. In the meantime, the seasoned gunslinger and freshly out of prison, Ryan, has already embarked on a journey of sweet retribution, unaware that before long, he will cross paths with Bill, sharing the same desire for justice. But what could possibly unite the two unlikely companions? Written by Nick Riganas\n\n\"Death Rides a Horse is one that Spaghetti Western fans (and fans of Lee Van Cleef) would thoroughly enjoy. The FILM is most watchable (read below about the DVD and possible hopes for a Region 1 letterbox DVD release), and Van Cleef is at his best in this one, playing a thug who is betrayed by his com padres. We usually see him playing the ultimate bad guy in most of his films, with his knife-deep stare filling the screen. At times, though, Van Cleef exposes his compassionate side for just a tease, and then just as quickly masks his inner humanity behind The Stare, as he plays Ryan, who arm-wrestles throughout the movie with stubborn youngster Bill (John Phillip Law), who has forsaken his lady and his life by embracing only revenge - and a single spur - after watching his father murdered, only to then bear witness to his mother and older sister brutalized at the hands of an out-of-control g*ng, greedy for gold. \n\nThe match-up between Ryan and Bill is one that plays itself out quite well, as Ryan acts as surrogate father, dishing out advice through some memorable quotes, teaching young Bill with his words and actions. Bill's anger is worn heavily on his sleeve, while Ryan steadily and calmly works out his own dishes of revenge, suppressing his anger even better than his empathy for Bill, which he touches on even as the pair first meet. Phillip Law was okay, but not thoroughly convincing as a bitter young man who witnessed his family's killing. Every once in a while, he might could have done just another take or two, but it's an easy pill to swallow since Van Cleef balances him out.\n\nI wouldn't want to go deeper into reviewing the movie, except that there's a nice plot twist somewhere inside the film. Many of the actors seen in this 1968 film have been in films by the great Sergio Leone. It seems that there was a core of actors who performed in a number of Italian Westerns, and for good reason: the chemistry was there. Add a good dose of Ennio Morricone film scores, and you have the potential for a quite watchable film. Most spaghetti's would be overcooked and unpalatable if not for Morricone music, which acts as an unseen, yet incredibly talented main character. \n\nOnce in a while, the dialog (like Bill's off-balance delivery: \"I'll find out who he is. If he is who I think he is...get ready to get mad\") detracts from the slow and steady pace of Death Rides a Horse (that line makes me want to Kill Bill, myself), but the overall storyline works well enough to entertain Spaghetti Western fans. There are very few plot holes to pick at in the film, which has an air of dread or darkness throughout much of its length. A lighter moment always seems to pop in just when the viewer might like to come up for air (like a character who offers Bill a kiss). \n\nFor those concerned about bad or unbelievable endings, Death Rides delivers without disappointment. \" Written by EyeDunno\n\n#freewestern #fullmovies #watchfree",

        "Description": "Spaghetti Western \"The Grand Duel\" AKA \"The Big Showdown\" or Ilgrande duello, Runtime 1h 38min, classic western movie, full length, free western movie. The Grand Duel  is a 1972 Spaghetti Western film directed by Giancarlo Santi, who had previously worked as Sergio Leone's assistant director on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West. The film stars Lee Van Cleef as a sheriff who seeks justice for a man accused of m*rder.\n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): Philip Wermeer has escaped from prison where he serves a sentence for the m*rder of Ebenezer Saxon, the patriarch of Saxon city, who in his turn is believed to be behind the m*rder of Wermeer’s father. Wermeer is holed up in Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers, who want his $3,000 reward, posted by Saxon's three sons David, Eli and Adam. A sheriff named Clayton arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen. While walking to the saloon, he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden (like throwing a lit match so a man hidden in hay has to put it out). Wermeer makes it to the saloon, where Clayton, who has counted Wermeer's shots and knows that he is out of bullets, arrests him. Hole, a spokesman for the bounty killers, calls on Wermeer to surrender. A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the \"dead\" convict. They argue that Clayton is a sheriff and therefore he cannot collect bounty, and that he instead should give up the body. The disagreement develops into a gunfight. Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes, pursued by the pack (though not Clayton). Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse, then hitches a ride with the stagecoach, where he finds Clayton among the passengers.\n\nWhen the group stay the night at Silver Bells, Wermeer goes for a shotgun hanging on the wall, but Clayton stops him. A drunken stationmaster assures the gun is empty, but Clayton retorts: \"Never consider a gun empty”. Then he and Wermeer play cards, Wermeer betting his $3,000 bounty. Wermeer wins and Clayton promises to take him to Saxon city as he wants. Wermeer steals a revolver from Clayton’s bag, but is told that it is empty. Wermeer repeats Clayton’s earlier saying and pulls the trigger, but Clayton shows him the bullet, taking it out of his mouth. Wermeer tries to leave, but Clayton shoots the door, this time with the other five bullets. Meanwhile, the bounty hunters led by Hole surround the house. They give Wermeer thirty seconds. He and Clayton are inside with Elisabeth, a female passenger who has earlier shown interest in Wermeer. Clayton tells her that Wermeer is innocent and that he saw who did it, but if Wermeer walks out the door he will never know. Wermeer gives himself up. Hole and two of the bounty hunters now kill the others in their pack, then ride off with Wermeer.\n\nClayton finds them beating and questioning Wermeer in a waterfall, asking where the silver of his father is and offering to let him go if he tells. Clayton shoots off the rope and liberates him. Wermeer asks if he is still a prisoner. When Clayton says no, he holds a gun against Clayton and rides off to Saxon city on the latter’s horse. After arriving Wermeer confronts the Saxon sons, Adam and Eli. He accuses Eli (who is the town's sheriff) and asks who killed his father. We also learn that Hole was sent by Eli to find out who really killed the old man Saxon. Clayton arrives and demands that the Saxons reopen Wermeer's case. Wermeer sends word to his friends and people loyal to his father to gather at the silver mine. A duel between Hole and Wermeer is supervised by Clayton after he reveals that it was Hole who killed Wermeer’s father, following orders from Ebenezer Saxon. An ambusher is there helping Hole, but Wermeer shoots him without Clayton interfering. (In a German-language version, the dying Hole says he killed Wermeer because the latter refused to share the silver.)................\n\nDirector: Giancarlo Santi\nWriter: Ernesto Gastaldi (screenplay)\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, Alberto Dentice, Jess Hahn\n\n#freemovies #cowboyfilm #westernmovies\n\n*****************\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film: The Rope and the Colt, 1969, Une corde, un colt... (original title) AKA \"Cemetry without Crosses\" or \"Cementerio s*in cruces\". Runtime 1h 30 min. French-Italian Spaghetti Western film by Robert Hossein, its director, co-screenwriter and star. A melancholic, fetishistic gunfighter is drawn into a vengeful and tragic kidna*pping plot by his widowed ex-lover.\n\nDirector: Robert Hossein\nWriters: Robert Hossein (scenario), Claude Desailly (scenario)\nStars: Michèle Mercier, Robert Hossein, Guido Lollobrigida\n\nIMDB: The Rogers family are rich and powerful cattle and land owners. The Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas and Eli - rebel against them and steal a shipment of gold coins. The Rogers are used to settling their affairs personally and kill Ben, while the other two manage to escape, although their house is burned down. Maria, Ben's wife, has only one wish: to avenge her husband's death. Only one person will help her to achieve this end: Manuel, a lonely gunfighter who accepts to help her due to his past relationship with Maria and Ben. Manuel decides to kidna*p Diana, the Rogers' beloved daughter, and Maria obliges her father and his three sons to humble themselves on Ben's grave and ask for forgiveness. However, both the Rogers and the Caines' plans for each other go awry... with tragic and deadly results.\n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): Will Rogers, the despotic patriarch of a wealthy cattle ranching family, forces the sheep farming Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas, and Eli - to sell off their livestock. In retaliation, the Caines steal a shipment of gold coins intended for the Rogers; during their escape, Ben is wounded. Thomas and Eli ride to their ranch, while Ben, upon returning to his home, is ambushed by the Rogers and lynched as his wife, Maria, is forced by Will's sons to watch. The Rogers then ride to Thomas and Eli's ranch and burn down their house. The brothers ride to Maria's home to find her burying her husband, and give her a third-share of the stolen money.\n\nDriven by revenge, Maria take the money to a ghost town surrounded by dunes, where she meets its lone inhabitant, Manuel. A gunfighter with a fetishistic habit of wearing a black leather glove in duels, Manuel had once shared a romantic relationship with Maria and a friendship with Ben, but he left the pair to marry in order to suppress his violent nature. Maria asks him to avenge Ben on her behalf - although reluctant and sceptical, Manuel accepts her offer.\n\nManuel rides to a nearby town and stays at a hotel that Will's sons frequent. In the saloon, vigilantes from the rival Vallee family confront and attack the Rogers brothers in an attempt to run them out of town; Manuel kills the Vallees, and is quickly arrested. The next morning, the Rogers brothers bribe the sheriff into releasing Manuel, and take him to the family ranch. Thankful for saving his sons, Will provides Manuel a job as the ranch's foreman. That night, Manuel dines with the Rogers and their ranch hands, during which he opens a jar of mustard to find a jack-in-the-box, resulting in both dinner tables erupting with laughter as they accept him as their friend.\n\nLater, Manuel opens the ranch's corral and frees the horses; during the commotion as the Rogers try to pursue their mounts, he ki*dnaps Diana, Will's teenage daughter, and takes her to the ghost town. Thomas and Eli r*ape Diana, while Maria and Manuel, growing increasingly impassioned and uncomfortable with the situation that is transpiring, wait outside in the street. Maria rides to the Rogers ranch and demands that they re-bury Ben in the town cemetery in exchange for Diana's life. They begrudgingly accept, and provide Ben with a sizeable funeral procession and burial. Thomas and Eli, fearing that Maria's revenge scheme will result in disaster, attempt to convince Manuel to surrender Diana to them, but they are forced to leave when he threatens to kill them.\n\n...\n\nManuel rides to the ghost town to see the Rogers waiting for him on one side of the street, and he guns them down in quick succession. Diana, on horseback and armed with a rifle, witnesses the duel. Manuel removes his \"killing glove\", disarms himself and confronts Diana, who shoots him and rides away as he collapses onto the sand and dies.\n\n\n**************\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

(original title), Runtime 1h 58 min., Action, Western.\n\nA band of Mexican gun-runners employed by a revolutionary general accept an American into their gang, unaware of his intentions.\n\nDirector: Damiano Damiani\nWriters: Salvatore Laurani (story and screenplay), Franco Solinas (adaptation)\nStars: Gian Maria Volontè, Klaus Kinski, Martine Beswick\n\nA Bullet for the General (Spanish: Quién sabe?), also known by its international title El Chucho Quién Sabe?, is a 1967 Italian Zapata Western film directed by Damiano Damiani, written by Salvatore Laurani and Franco Solinas, and starring Gian Maria Volontè, Lou Castel, Klaus Kinski and Martine Beswick. The film tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Niňo), who is a counter-revolutionary in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. This is one of the more famous Zapata Westerns, a subgenre of the spaghetti western which deals with the radicalizing of bad men and bandits into revolutionaries when they are confronted with injustice. Others in this subgenre include Compañeros, The Mercenary and perhaps most famously Duck, You Sucker! Some parts of the soundtrack, composed by Luis Enríquez Bacalov, are featured in the videogame Red Dead Revolver. \n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): During the Mexican Revolution, a Durango-bound government munitions train is forced to stop due to the presence of a crucified army officer on the tracks. El Chuncho Muños, a gun runner loyal to the revolutionary leader General Elías, leads his gang in an assault on the train. Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira attempts to save the officer, but upon being fatally wounded by Chuncho, he is forced to order the train to run the officer over and escape the bandits. Bill Tate, an American passenger on the train, kills the engineer and stops the train again, allowing Chuncho and his gang to kill the remaining soldiers and take their weapons. Posing as a former prisoner of the army, Tate joins the gang, and is quickly befriended by Chuncho, who nicknames him \"Niño\".\n\nAfter several heists, the gang travels to the town of San Miguel, where Chuncho meets with his old friend Raimundo to overthrow the weakhearted town boss, Don Felipe. Rosaria, Felipe's spirited wife, attempts to defend him; when Chuncho's men assault her, Tate angrily berates them for their behaviour. Chuncho shoots Guapo, a gang member, for attempting to kill Tate. Don Felipe is made to drive Chuncho and his gang back to San Miguel, and he is eventually executed.\n\nChuncho prepares to stay in San Miguel, drilling the villagers in the hopes of becoming a General himself; Tate convinces much of the gang to leave San Miguel so they can sell their weapons to Elías. Eventually missing his bandit lifestyle, Chuncho leaves San Miguel under the care of El Santo, his priestly half-brother, on the pretext of recovering a gold-plated Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun from his former gang. After killing one of them, Picaro, Chuncho resumes leadership of the others, hoping to sell the weapons to Elías before returning to San Miguel.\n\nElías' emissary arrives, but is pursued by army troops. Tate and Chuncho use the machine gun to decimate the troops, but at the cost of the lives of nearly all of Chuncho's remaining gang. Unseen by the others, Tate also kills the emissary. Adelita, Chuncho's last surviving loyal gang member, abandons the pair after her lover, Pepito, is killed in the battle. During the ride to Elías' camp, Tate falls victim to a malaria attack. While getting quinine pills for Tate, Chuncho finds a golden bullet among his possessions.\n\nChuncho and Tate arrive at Elías' camp the next morning, where they encounter several starving revolutionaries. Chuncho sells the guns and is paid five thousand pesos, before learning from Elías that the people of San Miguel were massacred by the army. Realising his irresponsibility, Chuncho allows himself to be taken away to be executed by Santo, one of the sole survivors of the attack. Meanwhile, Tate, from a high vantage point, shoots Elías and kills Santo before Chuncho's sentence can be carried out. Tate escapes as Elías' doctors pronounce his death: shot in the head with a golden bullet...\n\n#freemovies #moviesonline #watchfree\n\n************\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

It was directed by Burt Kennedy. Scripted in the style of The Dirty Dozen (1967), and designed as a vehicle for Yugoslavian theater and film matinee idol Bekim Fehmiu, the film featured an ensemble cast of well-known American actors. Noted as the boy in Shane (1953), actor Brandon deWilde appears in his last Western film before his death the following year. The film was shot largely on location in Italy, Spain and Yugoslavia. Many exterior scenes were filmed at the Fort Bowie set built in the Province of Almería, Spain, where the desert landscape and climate that characterizes part of the province have made it a much utilized setting for Western films, among those A Fistful of Dollars (1964), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and later 8 0 0 Bullets (2002). This same set was also used in the films Blindman (1971) with Ringo Starr and A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die (1972).\n\nArmy deserter Capt. Viktor Kaleb is offered a pardon and reinstatement in the cavalry if he agrees to lead a special forces group in a raid against an Apache stronghold into Mexico.\n\nDirectors: Burt Kennedy, Niksa Fulgosi (uncredited)\nWriters: Stuart J. Byrne (based on a story by), William H. James (based on a story by)\nStars: Bekim Fehmiu, Richard Crenna, Chuck Connors\n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): A US Army cavalry unit returns from a 2-week patrol to find the inhabitants of an outpost near its home fort have been killed by Apache Indians. Among the victims is the savagely tortured wife of the patrol's leader, Capt. Victor Kaleb (Bekim Fehmiu).\n\nKaleb believes part of the fault lies with the passive fort commander, Major Wade Brown (Richard Crenna). Kaleb shoots and wounds Brown, and deserts the army. He disappears into the southwestern frontier to wage a private w*ar of revenge against Apaches.\n\nTwo years later General Miles (John Huston) arrives at the fort with an offer for Kaleb. The scouts Natchai (Ricardo Montalban) and Tatting (Slim Pickens), old friends of Kaleb, are sent out to entice him back to the fort. With a bit of trickery they succeed.\n\nGeneral Miles tells Kaleb Apaches led by Chief Mangus Durango have gathered in Mexico, intending to cross the border and attack at any time. The General, over Brown’s objections, promises Kaleb amnesty in exchange for leading a select band of soldiers across the border to wipe out the Apache stronghold known as \"La Spina Dorsale Del Diavolo\", the Devil's Backbone.\n\nKaleb has his pick of the men at the fort. They include dynamite expert Reynolds (Chuck Conners), who also is a priest; knife-fighting expert Jackson (Woody Strode); and grizzled veteran Schmidt (Albert Salmi). Most of the men hate Kaleb. A blustery Englishman Crawford (Ian Bannen) sent by the British Army to study frontier tactics, and young army Lt. Ferguson (Brandon De Wilde), volunteer to go along.\n\nKaleb leads them into the desert to train them for the mission. It is severe, and result in some deaths. The band also encounters Apaches, who they kill. On their return to the fort, Major Brown reveals that, despite the general’s amnesty offer, he intends to arrest Kaleb for having shot him two years ago. In response the general orders Brown to accompany Kaleb on the mission. Brown cannot disobey. Natchai and Tattinger go along as well.\n\nThey cross the border. After smaller skirmishes there is a fierce battle with the main body of the Apache troops. Kaleb's elite force wins, in large part due to the advantages proffered by dynamite and machine gun fire. The victorious survivors return to the fort, where an embarrassed General Miles explains that despite his amnesty offer he has been ordered to arrest Kaleb. Colonel Brown suggests the resolution: they will all say Kaleb was killed in action at the Devil's Backbone. Kaleb mounts up and rides away from the fort back into the desert.\n\n\n\n******************************\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Arizona Colt Returns AKA If You Gotta Shoot Someone... Bang! Bang! - Cowboy Film, Full Length, Spaghetti Western, Anthony Steffen, 1970, Wild West.\n\nArizona Colt Returns (1970)\nArizona si scatenò... e li fece fuori tutti! (original title)\nDirector: Sergio Martino\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi, Joaquín Romero Hernández\nStars: Anthony Steffen, Marcella Michelangeli, Aldo Sambrell\nGenre: Western\nRuntime: 1h 27min\nCountry: Italy | Spain\n\nStoryline:\nFamed gunman Arizona Colt is sent by Moreno to rescue his daughter from the grips of Arizona's old enemy, Keane. But certain complications make the mission far more dangerous than expected.\n\nUser Review:\n''Of Course there are better, but I know a lot of spaghetti-western which are unbelievable worst. To start to write about the story is to explain the whole movie. It is a simple one, like other spaghetti-western, Arizona (the typical antihero) against a bunch of bandits. His funny sidekick has a silly name: Double Whiskey. You will see humor, cold blooded killing, torture and a lot of shooting. So everything someone can expect from an average spaghetti-western. There is nothing in this movie, you couldn't see in other spaghetti-western.\n\n\"Arizona Colt Returns\", or whatever the name is, is not a bad one, but it isn't a good one either. For spaghetti-western standards the violence is normal and not too brutal. So it isn't an ugly dirty one either. What is the best of this western? Maybe Anthony Steffen (or Anthonio De Teffé) as Arizona, but I liked his sidekick Double-Whiskey too. There are some scenes where these 2 characters are really funny together. I liked to watch the beautiful and good actress Rosalba Neri. Some more scenes with her would be helpful for this movie. Sometimes it seems that Rosalba was a little bit underchallenged in her role. Most of the other actors you have already seen in Movies made in Italy from that period. The sounds of composer Bruno Nicolai are great in this movie. Maybe the music is too good for a cheap movie like that.\n\nOverall I must say that \"Arizona Colt Returns\" was entertaining. And I think this is the most important thing about a movie like this. I had the luck to watch this movie with a not so poor quality. When you are someone who likes Western from Europe (even the worst), then you will enjoy \"Arizona Colt Returns\".''

It was first distributed in the United States in 1971.\n\nA trio of thieves plot to steal a town's silver shipment but a turn of events makes them the town's heroes.\n\nAfter robbing a stagecoach, the bandit Billy Joe Cudlip (Lee Van Cleef) becomes the friend of Czech immigrant Ben Novack, an honest engineer working for the mine company of Silverton. Cudlip is determined to \"go straight\", and after earning the trust of the citizens he is named the new sheriff of Silverton. But does he really want the job, or just access to the valuable shipments of the town's silver?\n\nDirected By: Giorgio Stegani\nWritten By: Fernando Di Leo, Warren Kiefer, Giorgio Stegani, Mino Roli\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, Antonio Sabato, Gordon Mitchell\nRuntime: 78 minutes\n\nwww.ROTTENTOMATOES.com: Unlike Clint Eastwood, who in the 1960s was cast as the Man With No Name, Beyond the Law star Lee Van Cleef has a name, and a very functional one. Van Cleef is known to one and all as Bandit Turned Sheriff. Actually, a more appropriate cognomen would be Bandit Turned Sheriff But Still a Bandit, since Van Cleef only pretends to reform so that he can steal a cavalry payroll. Since it's hard to watch Beyond the Law with a straight face to begin with, the producers wisely decided to turn this spaghetti western into a semi-comedy. Released in Italy in 1967 as Al Di La Della Legge, Beyond the Law was distributed in the US in 1971.\n\n#fullwestern #freewestern #grjngo\n\n**************\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

It bears a closer kinship with contemporary Italian \"spaghetti\" westerns than with the more conventional American variety. The story, which contains some bizarre touches (including necrophilia) concerns the efforts of a father and his adopted son to find the things they most want in life. Though for the father, gold holds much allure, love is the son's beacon. \n\nDirector: José Bolaños (as José Antonio Balanos)\nWriters: José Bolaños (as José Antonio Balanos), Pedro F. Miret (as Pedro Miret)\nStars: Glen Lee, Venetia Vianello, James Westerfield \n\nA traveling gravedigger during an (unspecified) war adopts a orphan he finds alone in the desert. After the war with the orphan grown and business slow, the orphan begins to generate business himself by shooting people. The orphan wants to make one big score by robbing a bank but the gravedigger resists. Their dream is to open a fancy funeral parlor and cemetery. The orphan becomes obsessed with a prostitute he saw who was later abandoned by her outlaw partner after a robbery attempt on a gold wagon goes bad. He eventually leaves the gravedigger to find her.\n\nIt’s the Civil War. A traveling gravedigger adopts an orphan he finds alone in the desert. With the boy grown, they wander through desert towns gathering the dead for burial, when they are unable to find any dead bodies they make their own! What begins as a western saga winds up as a wildly bizarre splatter flick.

First they need to locate the four clues, a tattoo on each of Wang's widow's butts, then uncover the fortune while being hunted by a religious fanatic/ ex-confederate soldier who is on to their game.\n\nAKA:\nRomania Bani însângeraţi\nDenmark Borte med westen\nFrance (video title) Dakota\nBelgium (Flemish title) De colt, de harde en de karate\nArgentina Dinero sangriento\nMexico (alternative title) El karateca y el pistolero\nDenmark (alternative title) Guld under baelestedet\nAustria In meiner Wut wieg' ich vier Zentner\nSoviet Union (Russian title) (transliterated ISO-LATIN-1 title) Krovnyye den'gi\nPoland Krwawe pieniądze\nWest Germany Kung Fu im wilden Westen\nBrazil (reissue title) Kung Fu na Trilha do Dinheiro Sangrento\nBelgium (French title) La brute, le colt et le karaté\nFrance La brute, le colt et le karaté\nFrance (video title) Le prix du sang\nChina (Mandarin title) (transliterated ISO-LATIN-1 title) Long hu zou tian ya\nHong Kong (Mandarin title) Long hu zou tian ya\nItaly Là dove non batte il sole\nSpain (working title) Moneda sangrienta\nBrazil (TV title) O Dragão Chinês e o Pistoleiro\nGreece (video title) O xenos kai o oploforos\nPortugal Onde o Sol Nunca Brilha\nDenmark (alternative title) Revolver-manden og den fremmende\nFinland (video title) Revolverimies ja muukalainen\nSweden Revolvermannen och främlingen\nNorway (video title) Revolvermannen og den fremmede\nCanada (English title) (alternative title) The Stranger and the Gunfighter\n\nReviews:\n\nThe king of the spaghetti westerns that isn’t Clint Eastwood teams up with the king of kung fu movies that isn’t Bruce Lee. Sure, that sounds like a diss but I am a pretty big fan of Lee Van Cleef and Lo Lieh. Both men owned the 1970s in their own way, so seeing them come together is pretty interesting. Sadly though, their talents and their team-up were wasted in this picture, which just doesn’t live up to whatever hype my mind might have had in the ’70s when this actually went down. The film’s premise is pretty interesting though. Ho Chiang (Lo Lieh) journeys to America from China in search of his uncle’s fortune. He discovers that his uncle is dead and the only man that knows where his body is, is the one accused of murdering him, an Old West gunslinger named Dakota (Lee Van Cleef). Once the uncle’s body is found, the pair find clues that point to the fortune. This then becomes a real spaghetti western treasure hunting movie with kung fu flair. The reluctant pair must track down the uncle’s mistresses, each of whom have a section of the treasure map tattooed on their bums. Ultimately, the two men become friends and kick a lot of as*s. The problem with the movie is that the execution is poor and really kind of lazy. Van Cleef and Lieh are both solid but the script just isn’t there and everything is fairly pedestrian. This is a film that is an example of wasted potential. But then again, a studio specializing in spaghetti westerns didn’t have much experience creating kung fu pictures just as Shaw Brothers, even with their input on kung fu filmmaking, didn’t know how to make westerns. And really, I’m not sure how much input Shaw Brothers actually had, it seems pretty minuscule.\n\n#freemovies #grjngo #watchfree\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

It is the first and only film collaboration between Mickey Hargitay and Gordon Mitchell. The two friends appeared together in Mae West's 1950s Las Vegas stage show, then traveled to Italy where they made sword and sandal films. It was the first Western for Gordon Mitchell. Told that the Italians preferred their Western heroes lean, Mitchell dropped his weight from 220 lbs (99.79 kg) to 170 lbs (77.11 kg).\n\nDirector: Emimmo Salvi\nWriters: James Wilde (story), Ambrogio Molteni\nStars: Gordon Mitchell, Mickey Hargitay, Milla Sannoner\n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): Ringo, Frank and their sidekick Tom are hired by Walton, a gunrunner to rescue Jane Walcom, his daughter from a band of Mexicans he did business with. Shooting their way through the mob, the rescue is a success, but Ringo and Frank's friendship is ruined when Jane marries Ringo. The two do not meet again until after the end of the American Civil War. Ringo has become the town sheriff and the father of a son. Frank returns to his hometown as a leader of a band of Confederate Guerrillas and outlaws. Frank obtains both wealth and revenge by hiring himself out to town boss Daniels who pays Frank to terrorise the town in order to obtain ranches from reluctant owners as well as murdering Ringo's mother and kidnapping Jane.\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Grjngo\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\nAKA:\n\n(original title) 3 colpi di Winchester per Ringo\nBrazil (DVD title) 3 balas para Ringo\nBrazil Três Tiros de Ringo\nDenmark Tre kugler til Ringos Winchester\nHungary Ringo bosszúja\nSoviet Union (Russian title) Три пули для Ринго\nSweden Winchester - Döden talar\nTurkey (Turkish title) Ringo'ya 3 el ates\nUSA Three Graves for a Winchester\nWest Germany Drei Kugeln für Ringo\n3 Bullets for Ringo\n\nMickey Hargitary plays Ringo Carson, one of three friends who rescue pretty Jane Walcom (Milla Sannoner) from Mexican bandits in return for a ransom from her father. Those friends include Tom (Spartaco Conversi) and Frank Sanders (Gordon Mitchell).\n\nBut Ringo and Frank have a falling out over Jane. Years later, Ringo and Jane are married and have a young son. Ringo, now a sheriff, is called on to help a neighboring town where Confederate marauders are on a rampage. He’s blinded rescuing a young boy; then saved by one of the marauders, none other than Frank Sanders.\n\nBut without his sight, Ringo can do little to help his mother, and she’s in a desperate situation.\n\nA banker named Daniels is after her land for the gold mine on it. He’s forged an allegiance with Jane’s father, who has found it more difficult to sell guns to the Mexicans with Ringo as sheriff.\n\nAnd now they enlist the help of Frank and his men, even making Frank the new sheriff.\n\n#freemovies #grjngo #watchfree\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: Gunfighter's Moon - A notorious gunfighter returns to his ex-wife, who only wants him to save her sheriff husband from being killed by gunmen out to free his condemned prisoner.\n\nGunfighter's Moon:\nDirector: Larry Ferguson\nWriter: Larry Ferguson\nStars: Lance Henriksen, Kay Lenz, David McIlwraith\nGenre: Action, Drama, Romance, Western\nRuntime: 1h 35min\nCountry: USA | Canada\nLanguage: English\nFilming Locations: British Columbia, Canada\n\nStoryline:\nHenrickson plays Frank Morgan, a notorious and feared gunfighter that has lived his life on the run. His face and eyes reveal a man that has been very much hardened by that life. We quickly learn, however, that there is still passion inside. Upon receiving a telegram from Linda, an old lover (played by Kay Lenz), requesting his presence, he abandons his woman, mounts his horse and rides to Linda without giving it a second thought. Upon arrival, he learns that Linda is now happily married to the owner of the local general store. The only vestige of her past that remains is a daughter, who Frank is surprised to learn is his. The daughter, of course, does not know about Frank. Linda, not wanting her to know that her father was a notorious gunfighter has given her a fictional father that died a hero's death at the First Battle of Bull Run. Frank quickly learns that Linda's reason for calling for him has nothing to do with romantic feelings. She wants him to protect her husband. It seems that there was an attempted bank robbery in town and the local sheriff and one of the robbers was killed. The other robber is in jail, waiting to be hanged, and Linda's husband has been appointed to the job of temporary sheriff. A cousin of the prisoner is set to be released from prison in a few days, and has made it clear that he will do whatever is necessary to get his kin out of jail. Linda's husband believes that the town will back him up when the showdown comes, but Linda knows better. She knows that he will be killed unless Frank agrees to help him. The story unfolds as Frank comes to terms with the fact that Linda and, for that matter, his newly discovered daughter are forever beyond his reach. He must decide whether to help the man that now has the woman he loves or to simply ride away.\n\nReview:\nI first saw this movie on a cable movie channel about six years ago. I only caught the last half of the movie, but I loved it so much I searched the TV listings and would watch it every time it came on. I would set my alarm for 2 or 3 AM, whenever it was scheduled, Finally I was asked what I wanted as a Christmas gift. The only thing I could think of was Gunfighter's Moon! When I received it, I was thrilled. I have watched it so many times that I have lost count. It never gets boring or old. It is a classic. Lance Henriksen was incredible as he portrayed Frank Morgan. I found myself \"caring\" for Morgan as he went through a range of emotions and conflicts. The only thing I am disappointed with is there was no sequel - I wish Gunfighter's Moon 2 had been considered and released. Maybe it will be. This movie has it all - love, struggles, gunfights, hard men and Lance Henriksen with an incredible smile.

        "Description": "Lightning Jack (Classic Western, Free Movie, English Film, Full Length) western movie on youtube\n\nLightning Jack (1994): Lightning Jack Kane is an Australian outlaw in the wild west. During a bungled bank robbery he picks up mute Ben Doyle as a hostage. The two become good friends, with Jack teaching Ben how to rob banks, while they plan Jack's last heist. \n\nDirector: Simon Wincer\nWriter: Paul Hogan\nStars: Paul Hogan, Cuba Gooding Jr., Beverly D'Angelo\nCountry: USA | Australia\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 2 June 1994 (Germany) \nAlso Known As: Jack Blyskawica \nFilming Locations: Monument Valley, Arizona, USA \nGenres: Comedy | Western\n\nPlot:\nPaul Hogan plays Lightning Jack Kane, a long-sighted Australian outlaw in the American west, with his horse, Mate. After the rest of his g*ng is killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, Jack survives only to read of the events in the newspaper that he was nothing next to others. Annoyed at not being recognised as an outlaw, Jack attempts a robbery by himself, and ends up taking young mute Ben Doyle (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as a hostage. He later discovers that, tired of never having been treated with respect due to his disability, Ben wishes to join him.\n\nJack attempts to teach Ben how to fire a gun and rob banks, with his first attempt at \"on-the-job\" training ending with Ben shooting himself in the foot. Across the course of the training, they pay occasional visits to saloons where Jack shows Ben the truth about adult life, including helping him to lose his virginity. However, the true nature of the saloon visits is for Jack to make contact with showgirl Lana Castel (Beverly D'Angelo), who, unbeknownst to Jack, is madly in love with him.\n\nWhen Ben's training is complete, the two learn of a bank which is said the entire town armed and ready to protect it. Jack sees this as the test he has been waiting for, and together they hatch a plan to rob it. Everything seems to be going smoothly and they are set to begin, until Jack discovers that a rival g*ng of outlaws is also planning to rob the bank. He is prepared to give up when Ben has a plan of his own.\n\nBen silently tips off the townspeople, who quickly swarm the bank with the rival outlaws inside. The g*ng are arrested and the entire town celebrates, allowing Jack and Ben to slip unnoticed into the bank and swiftly strip it clean. Before leaving, Jack jumps into the celebrations, ensuring that his grinning face is seen at the top of the town photo. By the time the true robbery is discovered, the two - and Lana - are gone, with a bounty of thousands on their heads and all of America searching for them - the life that Jack had always wanted.\n\nUser Reviews (IMDb.com):\n\n\"This is a comedy set in the old west. Even if it's not your favorite movie genre, it's worth watching if for no reason than the amazing acting by Cuba Gooding, Jr. It takes a talented actor to give such a strong performance without a single word of dialogue. Paul Hogan is as adorable as ever, although the role of Lightning Jack Kane doesn't differ much from his Crocodile Mick Dundee character. The supporting cast nicely fills out the roster of characters. I recommend this film for its light, entertaining value.\" Written by cheryl-142-917207\n\n\"Beautiful work by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this Western comedy with beloved Aussie hero (who also directs). All heart, but includes the necessary sweaty grimy sinister bad guys and violence. Lots of horses. (Great film to work for as a wrangler.) Also the gorgeous witty professional women. And Native American medicine. Good as a break from the daily grind.\" Written by abi_sheldon\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#freemovies #grjngo #watchfree\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Classic Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: The Big Trees is a 1952 Western film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Felix E. Feist. It was Kirk Douglas's final film for Warner Brothers, a film he did for free in exchange for the studio agreeing to release him from his long-term contract. Douglas plays a greedy timber baron who seeks to exploit the Sequoia forest, while facing the protest of the Quaker colonists.\n\nDirector: Felix E. Feist (as Felix Feist)\nWriters: John Twist (screenplay), James R. Webb (screenplay) | 1 more credit »\nStars: Kirk Douglas, Eve Miller, Patrice Wymore\n\nPLOT: In 1900, lumberman Jim Fallon (Kirk Douglas) greedily eyes the big sequoia redwood trees in the virgin region of northern California. The land is already settled by, among others, a religious group led by Elder Bixby (Charles Meredith) who have a religious relationship with the redwoods and refuse to log them, using smaller trees for lumber. Jim becomes infatuated with Bixby's daughter, Alicia (Eve Miller), though that does not change his plan to cheat the homesteaders. When Jim's right-hand man, Yukon Burns (Edgar Buchanan) finds out, he changes sides and leads the locals in resisting Jim. The locals combat Jim's loggers with a sympathetic judge with Jim fighting back by using Federal laws. Elder Bixby is killed when a big sequoia tree is chopped down by Jim's men and falls on his cabin. Jim's desperate attempt to rescue Alicia's father saves him from being convicted of murder. Meanwhile, timber rival Cleve Gregg (Harry Cording) appears on the scene, making it a three-way fight. Gregg and his partner Frenchy LeCroix (John Archer) try to assassinate Jim, but end up killing Yukon instead. Jim has a dramatic change of heart and leads the settlers in defeating Gregg and Frenchy. Afterwards, Jim marries Alicia and settles down.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n\n(original title) The Big Trees\nAustria Das Tal der Riesen\nAustria Für eine Handvoll Geld\nBrazil (cable TV title) O Bosque em Chamas\nBrazil Floresta Maldita\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title) Големите дървета\nCanada (English title) The Big Trees\nCanada (French title) La vallée des géants\nChile El bosque en llamas\nDenmark Big Trees\nFinland Suurten metsien miehet\nFrance La vallée des géants\nGermany (DVD title) Under Big Trees\nGreece (TV title) Ta megala dentra\nHungary Nagy fák\nItaly Il tesoro dei Sequoia\nPoland Wysokie drzewa\nPortugal Os Gigantes da Floresta\nRomania Arborii giganţi\nSoviet Union (Russian title) Большие деревья\nSpain La ley de la fuerza\nSpain (alternative title) Los gigantes del bosque\nSweden De stora träden\nWest Germany Für eine Handvoll Geld\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

To help do this, the captain brings in a party of women to keep his soldiers happy.\n\nReviews:\nA sad and dismal almost final ending for Robert Taylor. His handsome looks faded by time, drink, and possible lung cancer, Robert Taylor presents a depressing lifeless figure in this 3rd rate South American produced Western. As a big fan of Taylor, I really don't want to remember him in this film. Of course, this is easy to do, as this movie has virtually been lost to time. It's clear that Robert Taylor didn't have his heart in the role of \"Captain Martin\". He looks weather beaten, tired, and just plain worn out. His build is just too thin and he appears in ill health. Even the feel of this whole movie is that of people \"Beaten-Up\" by the passing of time and hard living. Savage Pampas is \"savage\" to watch. There is little to like and it's not even a pleasant night at the movies. Savage Pampas is just a dismal footnote in the faltering career of Robert Taylor. written by  Desiree1954\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Ten years later, a widow arrives in town intent to take revenge from her husband's killers.\n\nA Town Called Hell (1971)\nDirectors: Robert Parrish, Irving Lerner\nWriters: Richard Aubrey (screenplay), Richard Aubrey (story)\nStars: Telly Savalas, Robert Shaw, Stella Stevens\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Drama\nRuntime: 1h 37min\nCountry: UK | Spain\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: A Town Called Bastard (original title)\n\nStoryline:\nIn 1895, in a small town ravaged by the Mexican Revolution, the revolutionary leader Aguila and his men massacre the town's locals and the military garrison soldiers.Ten years later Aguila,now a reformed priest, sees a newly-arrived woman who is looking for those responsible for murdering her husband. The town is run by the corrupt Don Carlos who promises to help Alvira find those who killed her husband,in return for the gold reward Alvira is offering. Don Carlos has no idea where Aguila is or what Aguila looks like but he's prepared to do anything in order to collect the gold reward offered by Alvira. Everything is complicated by the sudden arrival of the Mexican Army led by a brutal Colonel whose face looks very familiar to the town priest.\n\nReviews:\n\"A Town Called Hell\" is a wonderful western that takes place in Mexico, circa 1905. Telly Savalas plays a memorable role as a villain looking for a mysterious man named \"Augila\". There is some good footage of hanging people. Telly Savalas's death scene is hilarious as it is brilliant. Martin Landau plays a jewish/mexican colonel who gets to wear a funny-looking brown mexican uniform, but no beanie.

        "Description": "Full Western Movie: A Town Called Hell - A group of Mexican revolutionaries murders a town priest and a number of his christian followers. Ten years later, a widow arrives in town intent to take revenge from her husband's killers.\n\nA Town Called Hell (1971)\nDirectors: Robert Parrish, Irving Lerner\nWriters: Richard Aubrey (screenplay), Richard Aubrey (story)\nStars: Telly Savalas, Robert Shaw, Stella Stevens\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Drama\nRuntime: 1h 37min\nCountry: UK | Spain\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: A Town Called Bastard (original title)\n\nStoryline:\nIn 1895, in a small town ravaged by the Mexican Revolution, the revolutionary leader Aguila and his men massacre the town's locals and the military garrison soldiers.Ten years later Aguila,now a reformed priest, sees a newly-arrived woman who is looking for those responsible for murdering her husband. The town is run by the corrupt Don Carlos who promises to help Alvira find those who killed her husband,in return for the gold reward Alvira is offering. Don Carlos has no idea where Aguila is or what Aguila looks like but he's prepared to do anything in order to collect the gold reward offered by Alvira. Everything is complicated by the sudden arrival of the Mexican Army led by a brutal Colonel whose face looks very familiar to the town priest.\n\nReviews:\n\"A Town Called Hell\" is a wonderful western that takes place in Mexico, circa 1905. Telly Savalas plays a memorable role as a villain looking for a mysterious man named \"Augila\". There is some good footage of hanging people. Telly Savalas's death scene is hilarious as it is brilliant. Martin Landau plays a jewish/mexican colonel who gets to wear a funny-looking brown mexican uniform, but no beanie. Robert Shaw, known for his classic performance as Quint in \"Jaws\", plays a priest.... or is he? Stella Stevens, a has-been, plays a blond prostitute. There are some good action scenes and Johnny Horton's \"The Battle Of New Orleans\" can be heard in the soundtrack in a flashback scene at a mexican dance party.

        "Description": "Custer Of The West - George Armstrong Custer's love of the heroic traditions of the Calvary and his distaste with the coming of industrialization leads him to his destiny at the Little Big Horn.\n\nCuster of the West (1967)\nDirector: Robert Siodmak\nWriters: Bernard Gordon, Julian Zimet\nStars:  Robert Shaw, Mary Ure, Ty Hardin\nGenre: Western, Biography, Drama, History \nRuntime: 2h 15min\nCountry: UK | France | Spain | USA\nLanguage: English\nFilming Locations: Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain\nAlso Known As: Last Post - US Kavallerie Western-Klassiker Box, \n\nStoryline:\nThe story of U.S. Army commander George Armstrong Custer, a flamboyant hero of the Civil War who later fought and was exterminated with his entire command by warring Sioux and Cheyenne tribes at the battle of Little Big Horn in 1876.\n\nReviews:\nThis is actually a sad movie. I will not mention the end for fear of including a \"spoiler\", but also I cannot imagine that most American viewers would not already know how it ends.\n\nThough I live overseas now I grew up in the United States in the 1960s (in fact, I still retain my U.S. citizenship). Some of the lines in this 1967 movie are, in fact, anachronisms (they were not in the language in the 1860s or 1870s when this movie was set). The phrase that one U.S. soldier was worth (in combat) 10 Indians was a takeoff on the phrase used at that time in the Vietnam War concerning the kill ratio. Also, the term that General Sheridan used, \"Bleeding hearts\" comes from the 1960s; not the 1860s. The director of this movie was obviously comparing the moral problems we felt with Vietnam with the same problems the U.S. felt during the Indian Wars a century before. I did not know, of course, any Indian War veterans, but I did know two good men who went to Vietnam and did not come back alive.\n\nAlso tearful is the real life love you detect between George and Libby Custer that is portrayed by the real life married couple of Robert Shaw and Mary Ure. Six children between them. She died about ten years later from an accidental overdose of alcohol mixed with sleeping pills. He was so heartbroken that he died a few years later literally of a broken heart.\n\nIt is still a magnificent film. The western scenes are indigenous to that part of the United States that it is actually a shock to find out they were filmed not in South Dakota, California, Nevada, Kansas,etc. but rather in Spain!! written by enthusiast\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "A Minute to Pray a Second to Die - In Tuscosa, New Mexico, the Governor offers amnesty papers to all outlaws but gunfighter Clay McCord's appearance triggers a violent confrontation between the local marshal, McCord, and other outlaws.\n\nA Minute to Pray a Second to Die (1968)\nDirector: Franco Giraldi\nWriters: Louis Garfinkle, Ugo Liberatore\nStars:  Alex Cord, Arthur Kennedy, Robert Ryan\nGenre:  Action, Crime, Drama, Western\nRuntime: 1h 57min\nCountry: Italy | USA\nLanguage: English | Italian\nFilming Locations: Spain\nAlso Known As: Dead or Alive\n\nStoryline:\nWhen outlaw Clay McCord learns the Governor of New Mexico has offered an amnesty to all who apply for it at the town of Tuscosa, he is intrigued but suspicious. He circles the vicinity, weighing the offer and encountering other outlaws, all the while troubled by occasional \"spells\" resembling the epileptic fits which plagued his father. Eventually McCord reaches Tuscosa where he clashes with the local marshal, Roy Colby. The Governor then arrives and tries to calm the situation, knowing that if McCord asks for amnesty, other outlaws will follow. Events lead to a shoot-out with McCord, Colby, and the Governor on one side while a band of outlaws comprise the other.\n\nReviews:\nAlex Cord stars in this beautifully-photographed Spaghetti Western about a gunfighter with an arm that goes into epileptic fits under pressure. After a local town decides to give amnesty and $50 to gunfighters that give themselves up, Cord strongly considers giving up his run-n-gun lifestyle. But of course there's bounty hunters, bandits and lawmen who don't exactly take a liking to that so Cord is gonna' need a lot of bullets. The action sequences are average for a Spaghetti (good guy shoots a bunch of times, bad guys throw their arms straight into the air and spin around) but the direction is quite good and the storyline is intriguing. Robert Ryan shows up to kick some ass and add some class to the proceedings. written by Samoan Bob\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

They murder everyone there except for one young woman, who they keep alive hoping she'll lead them to more gold. Only Pitcalin among the five men shows kindness to the prisoner. An Apache brave who was away from the camp discovers the massacre and buries the dead. Then he tracks the murderers and brings slow but steady vengeance upon them.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The story follows a bunch of amoral morons into the wild west. That may sound like a boring story, but it's told with such humor and madcap idiocy that one can't help but be entertained throughout the whole thing. The sight gags are pretty cool too. For example, the main Indian character, Cold Arm Warm Legs, wears a sweater with a breechcloth. This movie has it all - from stupid Bible misquotings, to Spanish speaking Indians, to a bathing woman and a love affair.\n\nIn conclusion, you should stop reading this review and go buy this movie now!\" Written by deadskunk18 via IMDb.com\n\n\"One of the best of Starrett's low budget action-Pictures of the seventies, this intriguing Western was co-produced by its star, Jody (son of Joel)McCrea. Told in flashback by McCrea as an old man (played by Joel) as he reminisces about his past, McGregor's screenplay has McCrea and a bunch of prospectors slaughtering a band of Indians until the last one left, Gahva, promises to tell them the whereabouts of a gold mine and lead them there. On the way they are pursued by Gahva's brother, who murders them one by one (including director Starrett), until Gahva kills him to save McCrea.\" Written by discount1957 via IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Though they don't like each other very much, the two use the time to embark on an inept crime spree that keeps getting interrupted by a gang of real criminals.\n\nA genuinely likable and often times really funny western comedy, this is a good showcase for Italian western superstar Gemma, who gets to show off his charisma, as well as his prowess as an action star, doing all or most of his own stunts.\n\nThere's some good action action sequences here too, including a rowdy bath-time punch-out/gunfight and an exciting train robbery climax, all leading to a finale that actually rips off the final scene of The Graduate!\" Written by FightingWesterner via IMDb.com\n\n\"Not all of the slapstick works, but there are more hits than misses. Frankly I think the humor and production values are better here than all but the first of \"Trinity\" western-comedies. The English dubbing is not \"awful,\" as one reviewer stated. It's actually better than in many spaghetti Westerns. I liked the attention to detail in the depiction of even minor characters, like the bank employees & dishonest doctor who encases one brother in a total body cast. While I agree the American distributors were guilty of giving this film an terrible \"let's cash on on a better movie\" title, I don't think seeing the prelude would have added much.The picture already seems a bit too long, with a throw in the kitchen sink approach to the screen writing (\"Then's let's have them try this and fail, an then this...\"), when a plot more focused on one or two criminal acts might have been better. I also watched this as part of the Mill Creek 20 pack, mostly to get Monte Hellman's \"China 9, Liberty 32\" and \"The Big Gundown\" I have only found one (so far) that was truly unwatchable (\"Apache Blood\"). My main complaint is being deprived, in most cases, of seeing the films in the original Techniscope widescreen process (similar to Superscope but invented at Technicolor's Italian lab), which, through setting the number of frames per inch of film higher in the camera, used only half as much film as Cinemascope or Panavision did. Some complained they could see more grain in the projected image in theaters, but in many cases that worked to the film's advantage, contributing to a gritty washed out look. As with Superscope (now called Super 35), the anamorphic squeeze was done in the lab on an optical printer, enabling the directors to use normal rather than expensive anamorphic lenses in shooting these movies. Unlike Techniscope, Superscope used a normal frame in the camera, so did not save any film stock. The price of film stock was a large part of the cost of making feature movies back then. Now, with digital video, it's not an issue.\" Written by azjimnson via IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "A Minute to Pray a Second to Die - In Tuscosa, New Mexico, the Governor offers amnesty papers to all outlaws but gunfighter Clay McCord's appearance triggers a violent confrontation between the local marshal, McCord, and other outlaws.\n\nA Minute to Pray a Second to Die (1968):\nDirector: Franco Giraldi\nWriters: Louis Garfinkle, Ugo Liberatore\nStars:  Alex Cord, Arthur Kennedy, Robert Ryan\nGenre:  Action, Crime, Drama, Western\nRuntime: 1h 57min\nCountry: Italy | USA\nLanguage: English | Italian\nFilming Locations: Spain\nAlso Known As: Dead or Alive\n\nStoryline:\nWhen outlaw Clay McCord learns the Governor of New Mexico has offered an amnesty to all who apply for it at the town of Tuscosa, he is intrigued but suspicious. He circles the vicinity, weighing the offer and encountering other outlaws, all the while troubled by occasional \"spells\" resembling the epileptic fits which plagued his father. Eventually McCord reaches Tuscosa where he clashes with the local marshal, Roy Colby. The Governor then arrives and tries to calm the situation, knowing that if McCord asks for amnesty, other outlaws will follow. Events lead to a shoot-out with McCord, Colby, and the Governor on one side while a band of outlaws comprise the other.\n\nReviews:\nAlex Cord stars in this beautifully-photographed Spaghetti Western about a gunfighter with an arm that goes into epileptic fits under pressure. After a local town decides to give amnesty and $50 to gunfighters that give themselves up, Cord strongly considers giving up his run-n-gun lifestyle. But of course there's bounty hunters, bandits and lawmen who don't exactly take a liking to that so Cord is gonna' need a lot of bullets. The action sequences are average for a Spaghetti (good guy shoots a bunch of times, bad guys throw their arms straight into the air and spin around) but the direction is quite good and the storyline is intriguing. Robert Ryan shows up to kick some ass and add some class to the proceedings. written by Samoan Bob\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "White Apache - . When a group of outlaws attack and destroy a wagon train, the only survivor gives birth to a baby, whom the Indian chief, White Bear brings up as his son and calls him Shining Sky.\n\nWhite Apache (1987):\nDirectors: Claudio Fragasso, Bruno Mattei (as Vincent Dawn)\nWriters: José María Cunillés, Francesco Prosperi (as Franco Prosperi)\nStars: Sebastian Harrison, Lola Forner, Alberto Farnese\nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: Italian\nRelease Date: 26 August 1987 (France) \nAlso Known As: Bianco Apache\nFilming Locations: Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStory:\nOutlaws attack a band of settlers and kill everyone except a pregnant woman who's rescued by a band of Indians. The woman dies giving birth but Chief White Bear adopts her male baby, naming him \"Shining Sky,\" and raising him as brother to his own son, Black Wolf. The boys grow up together and good-naturedly compete for the affections of pretty Rising Star. In a competition, Shining Sky accidentally kills Black Wolf, is forced from the tribe, and finds work in a nearby town where he pretends to be a mute. A townswoman named Isabella flirts with him but when he spurns her she yells \"Rape!\" Bart Ryder, henchman of the local \"Colonel,\" runs Shining Sky out of town, hangs him by the wrists, and leaves him to die. Crazy Bull rescues Shining Sky and takes him back to the Indian village where he's reunited with Rising Star. Ryder, however, seeks to finish the job of killing the \"White Apache.\" Written by dinky-4 of Minneapolis\n\nReview:\n\"Apache Kid opens with a murderous attack by Southern renegades on a Mormon wagon train; the Mormons had already made friendship with the Indians, and all men, women and children, red or white, are killed, except for one woman, who is saved by a group of Apaches arriving in the last minute (1). She dies while giving birth to a son, who is adopted by the chief and raised as if he were his own flesh and blood. Because of his pale blond hair the boy is called Shining Sky. The chief's own son, Black Wolf, and Shining Sky grow up together, and eventually become inseparable, but then a beautiful young squaw comes between them, the long-legged, sharp-nosed Rising Sun. When Black Wolf is accidently killed during a game that got out of hand, Shining Sky is forced to leave the tribe and sent to the world of the white people. He's hired by a friendly horse trailer, but also encounters a group of cutthroats who plan to annihilate the Indians because they are \"in the way of progress\".\n\n\nWhen it was released theatrically, the film makers pretended it was a fateful adaptation of historic events. Most likely Apache Kid is (very) loosely based on the historic character called Apache Kid, a white kid captured by Indians at a very young age, who became a street orphan in army camps after being freed by the US army. The character of the sympathetic horse trainer seems based on Al Sieber, the Chief of Army scouts who more or less adopted the kid (2).\n\n\nSebastian Harrison is the son of muscle man (and star of many a peplum and spaghetti western) Richard Harrison. Both men would also be involved in the writing of the twin movie Scalps, but have no active part in the production of it (Richard Harrison couldn't finance it and then sold his rights). Scalps is the better of the two movies, mainly because it has a more engaging story. The storyline of Apache kid is simple, and yet the script often feels disjointed; soap opera scenes of two boys growing up together and romantic interludes in David Hamilton style are alternated with scenes of excessive slaughter and torture. It feels more like an exploitation movie than a spaghetti western; it's not excessively gory, but a pregnant Mormon woman is kicked in the groin, the kid's left arm is broken by repeated kicks and Rising Star is beaten up severely by several men and subsequently shot to pieces. All in close up. The ending is downright confusing.\" Written by Simon Gelten via spaghetti-western.net\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The characters are very amusing especially Tomas Milian who gives us a beautiful interpretation of a funny sort of bounty killer called \"Provvidenza\". This movie will make you laugh a lot without be vulgar or foregone. Least but not last the nice soundtrack by Ennio Morricone will remain stamped in your mind!\" Written by Dr. Vornoff on IMDb.com\n\n\"\"Death Rides A Horse\" director Giulio Petroni's \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" is a slapstick Spaghetti western comedy that is nothing like his other westerns. Genre stalwart Tomas Milian plays a mustached bounty hunter named Providence. He wears his derby so low that it crimps his ears with comic results. He speaks with a weird nasal lisp and looks incredibly buffoonish in his suit and tie with gloves. He travels around in a modified Wells Fargo stagecoach. Paunchy American character actor Greg Palmer co-stars with Milian in his silly frontier saga. He plays a thick-headed outlaw called the Hurricane Kid. Six scenarists, including Franco Castellano, Günter Ebert, Antonino Marino, Giuseppe Moccia, Antoinette Pellevant , and Piero Regnoli, along with Petroni himself have fashioned a lowest common denominator comedy not unlike the \"Trinity\" movies. Palmer makes a perfect Bud Spencer type, while Milian hams it up as an umbrella-toting bounty hunter who wields a derringer with a deadly accurate aim. When they are playing everything for laughs, the filmmakers appropriate the plot from Leone's \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" as Providence brings Hurricane in for the reward money and then engineers Hurricane's subsequent escape so they can pull the same stunt again. \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" appears to have been lensed in Italy rather than Spain since we never see any of those distinctive Spanish mountains. In other words, most everything looks green. Tomas Milian is nothing like you've ever seen him in a Spaghetti western. Incredibly, this unprepossessing oater boasts a musical score performed by Ennio Morricone. There are some interesting gags, especially the game of pool. Difficult as it is to believe this farce actually spawned a sequel the following year entitled \"Here We Go Again, Eh Providence?\" Milian and Palmer both reprised their roles. Italian tough guy stunt man Giovanni Cianfriglia plays a card-sharp thug who is roundly trounced in that hilarious pool tournament with Providence. Mind you, only fans of the Marx Brothers will appreciate a gag about tw0-third of the way through the film that is a variation on a Frank Tashlin gag from \"A Night in Casablanca.\" Harpo is leaning against a building when a French policeman asks him if he (Harpo) thinks that he is holding up the building. Harpo nods with an impish grin, steps away from the building and the edifice collapses. Hurricane is leaning against a tree when Providence asks him a similar question. Hurricane steps away from the tree and it keels over and hits the ground. Altogether, \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" shows not only Tomas Milian in a different light but also director Giulio Petroni in an entirely different light. \" Written by zardoz-13 on IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "The Mercenary - A greedy Polish mercenary aids a mine worker and peasant girl as they lead a revolution against the oppressive Mexican Government, and are pursued by an American rival.\n\nThe Mercenary (1968):\nDirector: Sergio Corbucci\nWriters: Franco Solinas (story), Giorgio Arlorio (story)\nStars: Franco Nero, Tony Musante, Franco Giacobini\nGenre: Comedy, Western\nRuntime: 1h 45min\nCountry: Italy | Spain | USA\nLanguage: English | Italian | Spanish\nFilming Locations: Madrid, Spain\nAlso Known As: Il mercenario (original title)\n\nStoryline:\nWhile a Mexican revolutionary lies low as a U.S. rodeo clown, the cynical Polish mercenary who tutored the idealistic peasant tells how he and a dedicated female radical fought for the soul of the guerrilla general Paco, as Mexicans threw off repressive government and all-powerful landowners in the 1910s. Tracked by the vengeful Curly, Paco liberates villages, but is tempted by social banditry's treasures, which Kowalski revels in.\n\nReviews:\nI recently got hold of the Japanese DVD print via ebay. This is of really high quality and I was amazed that this film is not more widely known or appreciated. What a brilliant film. In many ways it is similar to Companeros and if you liked that wonderful film you will also love this. The story is somewhat far-fetched but is very enjoyable and fast paced in a 'boys own' way. The machine gun makes its familiar appearance. Franco Nero, as always, delivers a superb performance and Jack Palance gives a very good performance as a very unpleasant killer. The music is brilliant and the duel in the bullring is incomparable and is perfectly choreographed to the wonderful music. If you are interested in westerns you have to see this film. Written by washboard via IMDb.com\n\n\"The second collaboration of Sergio Corbucci, the Italian Western's most important director besides Sergio Leone, and Franco Nero, one of the genre's greatest actors, after the ingenious \"Django\" from 1966, \"Il Mercenario\", a movie set in the time of the Mexican revolution, and therefore late for a Western, is a must-see for every fan of the genre.\n\nSergei Kowalski (Franco Nero) gets hired by short-tempered revolutionary Paco Roman (Tony Musante), in order to help his squad of unexperienced rebels with their campaign for a free Mexico. While Paco is a crook, but also an idealist, becoming more and more idealistic after his troop is joined by beautiful and idealistic Columba, a woman whose father was a revolutionary , the Polish is a typical anti-hero, witty and cool and somehow sympathetic, but mainly concerned on his own benefit.\n\nThe acting is great, specially Franco Nero as the Polish, and Jack Palance's performance as one of the villains. Another villain is played by Eduardo Fajardo, who played the villainous Major Jackson in Django. The score of this movie, composed by Ennio Morricone, is just brilliant (how couldn't it), the cinematography is great as well as the locations. My favorite film by Corbucci is still the incomparably brilliant \"Il Grande Silenzio\" (\"aka. \"The Great Silence\") of 1968, \"Django\" of 1966 being my second-favorite due to its immense entertainment- and cult-value. Maybe not quite as brilliant as \"Il Grande Silenzio\" and not quite as influential as \"Django\", \"Il Mercenario\" is nonetheless an exceptional Spaghetti Western with a great sense of humor that I would recommend to everybody, not only genre fans. 9 out of 10!\" Written by Witchfinder-General-666 via IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "To Hell and Back - Johnny King, a rebellious drifter, sets out to avenge the death of his mentor and friend, Steve, after he has been murdered for his land by the Ward Brothers.\n\nTo Hell and Back (1968)\nDirector: Giovanni Fago\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi (screenplay), Ernesto Gastaldi (story)\nStars: George Hilton, Paolo Gozlino, Claudie Lange \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 April 1969 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Cehenneme bir kişi daha \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nJohnny King, a rebellious drifter, sets out to avenge the death of his mentor and friend, Steve, after he has been murdered for his land by the Ward Brothers. After causing some trouble for the Wards, Johnny faces a new opponent, his outlaw friend, Meredith.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is a very entertaining SW from Giovanni Fago and the prolific western and horror screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. Fago had collaborated with Gastaldi before on Vengeance Is Mine (1967) and the next year would direct the Tomas Milian vehicle O Cagnaciero!, which points back to the influence on the SW of the Brazilian film Black God White Devil (1964).\n\nA buddy film, the light slapstick of the first half of the film plays well as the rather effeminate gunfighter Johnny King (George Hilton) runs through a number of dangerous situations with a sarcastic grin, fighting off land speculators, sleeping with the sheriff's flame, participating in a barroom fight in drag, in a knock-down drag-out fight in a jail cell, escaping from jail and then concocting an absurd but successful plan to rob a bank. During all this he meets Meredith (played by Paolo Gozlino), a rough but incompetent bandit who meets with surprising success when matched with the clever King.\n\nThe comedy darkens, though, when King returns to town after the bank heist to find his former guardian Pastor Steve killed by the land speculators. Then ensues the plot for revenge, which involves absurd methods of murder and torture and a final gunfight reminiscent of the finale to Taste For Killing. King gives up ruffles for black (he had trained in seminary, he claimed at one point) and begins quoting passages from the Bible.\n\nGerard Hertar is his usual sinister best as the sharp shooting Ernest Ward. He would play a similar role in the riotous Adios Sabata (1970). In the world of the SW, wealthy landowners indulge in the Sadean pleasures of target practice at live targets, almost always human. Besides Adios Sabata and Full House For The Devil, you find similar scenes in Django and The Fighting Fist Of Shanghai Joe.\n\nThe film follows the usual SW plot of an arrogant character that takes on more than he can handle, is humbled (beaten, shot, burnt, hung, crucified) before he either changes certain elements of his character or learns the secret (the iron plate in Fistful Of Dollars) necessary to ultimately succeed. Ernesto Gastaldi isolated this basic storyline in most of his westerns and used to again in this film.\" Written by rmahaney4 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): Uno di più all'inferno\nBrazil: Mais um para o Inferno\nFrance: Los machos\nGreece (video title): Enas akoma gia tin Kolasi\nGreece (transliterated title): Fotia apo dodeka pistolia\nItaly: Uno di più all'inferno\nPortugal: Mais Um para o Inferno\nSpain: Uno más al infierno\nTurkey (Turkish title): Cehenneme bir kişi daha\nUSA: To Hell and Back\nUSA: One More to Hell\nUSA (poster title): Full House for the Devil\nWest Germany: Django - Melodie in Blei\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Since the husband's will leaves his land to his nephew, the woman and her brother hire a gunman to eliminate this nephew before he can claim his inheritance. The nephew, however, proves to be a resourceful fighter -- good both with his gun and with his fists -- and he manages not only to close in on his foes but also to form an alliance of sorts with the gunman who's been hired to kill him.\n\nReviews:\n\"After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his ailing uncle's ranch to take over day to day operations, only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the woman's vicious brother.\n\nGood production values, a likable performance by Mark Damon, and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, above average addition to the spaghetti western genre.\n\nCo-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European babes ever to grace the screen. Here she's absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user (and abuser) of weak men.\n\nDamon and Neri appeared together in at least one other picture, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie that's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what's underneath Rosalba's dresses.\" Written by FightingWesterner via IMDb.com\n\n\"This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\"). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film I have EVER seen!\" Written by Chris_Casey via IMDb.com\n\n\"Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film (so not really spoiler after all). Saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it. It's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town. It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially wicked. She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply. She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but that's another story, which I don't remember too good. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film, who pretends to be anything but wicked - can't be compared with the witch in 'Snowwhite', who, in comparison is easy to find out. Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing.\" Written by karlericsson via IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#freemovies #grjngo #watchfree\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

I couldn't believe my luck at being able to see this great movie again.\n\nThe only difference is that this time is in English with Greek subtitles when before I watched it in Italian.\n\nIn short, Gary Ryan, the new Sheriff of Greenfield falls for a trap and finds himself locked up under false testimony by Cheryl, the woman who owns the biggest hotel in Greenfield. Eventually he finds a way out to struggle against all odds for justice\n\nThe other fascinating things about the movie are the names of the locations such as New Face Rock, Devils Cliff etc, inspired by nature.\n\nHere are some impressive lines: \"What I think doesn't mean much unfortunately, proof and testimony are the only languages that the law recognizes\" by Judge Anderson of Greenfield \"Unreasonably risking your neck is against Gods law\" by Padre Carmello. \"He could be almost anywhere looking for some place to hide, alone hunted by the law and society-Wanted\" by Martin Heywood (the Professional Gambler. \"Pray your last, coward\" by Fred Lloyd.\n\nExciting story line, beautiful scenery, good camera works, especially the angles and moreover, the score is not short of Ennio Morricone. I would recommend to any Spaghetti fan.\" Written by aheibe on IMDb.com\n\n\"In spite of what my fellow commenter states this is a fabulous Euro Western film by visionary director Giorgio Ferroni, who endows what might be an otherwise routine Oater about organized cattle rustling into a unique genre pastiche. Giuliano Gemma is well suited to the role of the lawman wrongly fingered for a crime he didn't commit seeking justice south of the border amongst the heavily made up extra actors who look about as authentic as Mexican peasants as the Little Rascals would.\n\nWhat makes the film work is Ferroni's visual prowess, combining sound stage footage with location work (some of which looks like Yugoslavia or maybe France) and a profound grasp of how to use color to make visual compositions that just happen to represent a cowboy movie. This one isn't quite a \"Spaghetti Western\", with a plot-heavy story rather than the usual posturing and exaggerated artiness of a Leone or Corbucci film. There are very few closeups of people's shoes, and the action sequences are more or less straightforward. The movie existed on the page before being visually realized.\n\nAnd for that reason I find it interesting; there is a surrealist bent going on here creating realities that are more \"real\" than a John Ford movie. What the movie may be lacking in terms of authenticity or visual flair is more than compensated for by a deliberate sense of composition. The movie looks like a storyboarded cartoon or graphic novel rather than a sprawling, dusty film epic, and the attention to character & set detail is refreshing.\n\n7/10\" Written by Squonkamatic on IMDb.com\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #western #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "God Made Them... I Kill Them -  A bounty-hunter (Dean Reed) is hired by the residents of a small town on the Mexican border to stop a series of gold robberies by marauding outlaws who are coordinated by the town's corrupt banker. \n\nGod Made Them... I Kill Them (1968)\nDirector: Paolo Bianchini\nWriter: Fernando Di Leo\nStars: Dean Reed, Pietro Martellanza, Piero Lulli\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 5 June 1970 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: God Forgives: His Life Is Mine\n\nStoryline:\nA bounty-hunter (Dean Reed) is hired by the residents of a small town on the Mexican border to stop a series of gold robberies by marauding outlaws who are coordinated by the town's corrupt banker.\n\nReviews:\n\"\"Machine Gun Killers\" director Paolo Bianchini has helmed a clever, rambunctious, 90-minute, Spaghetti western shoot'em up based on Fernando Di Leo's gritty screenplay that pits a splendidly attired, Paladin-type, ladies man, troubleshooter named Slim Corbett (Dean Reed of \"Adios Sabata\") who travels in style in an elegant carriage and requires a thousand dollars a week plus expenses for his services. Indeed, handsome Dean Reed resembles Roger Moore from the NBC-TV series \"Maverick\" in his stylish suit of clothes and handy way with cards. The very important people of Wells City have hired Corbett after they discover that their bank has been robbed during the night and no clues are available. \"God Creates Them, I Kill Them\" benefits from the scenic widescreen cinematography of \"Today It's Me... Tomorrow It's You!\" lenser Sergio D'Offizi who captures all the action with a sense of style. The camera work is excellent, too, especially when the camera dollies around the actors during a shoot-out.\n\n\"God Creates Them, I Kill Them\" opens rather like \"God Forgives, I Don't\" as the banker and his assistants enter the bank in the morning and find all the money in the safe gone and guards sprawled around dead without a clue in sight. No sooner have the promienent citizens of Wells City agree to hire Corbett than he finds himself in trouble when he rides into town. Several ruffians try to take advantage of him and he shoots them. Corbett is a deadly accurate marksman. The town judge, Judge Kincaid (Ivano Staccioli of \"Any Gun Can Play\"), is the only one among the citizens that aligns himself with Corbett. Interestingly, one of those prominent citizens is Don Luis (Peter Martell of \"The Cobra\"), a wealthy Mexican landowner. Don Luis defies the usual stereotype of the sweaty, overweight Mexican who bellows with laughter after he says anything. It is interesting to note in one scene that Don Luis tortures a peasant type who has been working in cahoots with our hero.\n\nAlthough he is no Sergio Leone when it comes to choreographing gunfights, Bianchini stages several decent shoot-outs with our handsome hero knocking down the opposition like ten-pins in a bowling alley. This Spaghetti western has enough shoot-outs and scheming to please fans of the genre and the production values are above-average.\" Written by zardoz-13 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Dio li crea...

The daughter of the Campos family and the son of the Mounter family fall in love, thus causing further hatred and deaths. \n\nReviews: \n\"It's not the first time that a drama of Shakespeare or another classical is adapted and free interpreted for a Spaghetti Western. The story is about the war between two rancher families: Monter and the Campos. In the Shakespeare Drama the two are named Montague and Capulet. The son of the Monter who is named Johnny not Romeo has not many experiences with Guns and Women. Fortunately he got a teacher an old outlaw called Lefty and he meets Guiletta Campos the daughter of the Campos Chief. She is espoused to another man but fells in Love with the son of her father's enemy. The cast of the two lovers are Peter Lee Lawrence and Cristina Galbò. It's interesting that both became a couple during making FURY OF JOHNNY KID and married few years later. There is obviously good chemistry between them. Nevertheless the movie is more a spaghetti western as a romantic drama with typical violent scenes, a revenge story and a buddy next to the hero. The typical Buddy story it's about an old outlaw is teaching a young fellow. The Buddy (Andrès Mejuto) is called Lefty and he has only one hand left. All actors are pretty good and the movie is without strange overacting you see in so many contributions of this genre. Somehow it's like an Adult Western without childish elements you'll find in most western from Italy.\n\nNext to these \"normal\" western stories there are some extraordinary scenes. I didn't expect the end and Yes that's what I would call a weird movie. FURY OF JOHNNY KID is the only western directed by Gianni Puccini who is better known for his work on more sophisticated Movies. He did quiet a good job as also the composer Gino Peguri and the cinematography by Mario Monturi have done.\n\nFURY OF JOHNNY KID was a big surprise for me. It's a weird Spaghetti Western for Adults with good Acting, Directing and a fine score. I enjoyed this unusual Movie with a suspenseful story and many interesting scenes and at least some connection to the great Drama of Shakespeare.\" Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Dove si spara di più\nBrazil: Seis Mandamentos para um Pistoleiro\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Яростта на Джони Хлапето\nDenmark: Helvedesmassakren\nFinland: Hirttäjäiset\nFrance: Un doigt sur la gâchette\nGermany (DVD title): Glut der Sonne\nJapan (Japanese title): 荒野の墓標\nNorway: Ride for massacre\nPeru: Django no perdona\nPortugal: A Fúria de Johnny Kid\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Там, где часто стреляют\nSpain: La furia de Johnny Kid\nSpain: La furia de Johnny Kidd\nSweden: Ett helvete för Johnny Gringo\nUSA: Ultimate Gunfighter\nUSA: Fury of Johnny Kid\nUSA (alternative title): Ride for a Massacre\nWest Germany: Glut der Sonne\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

So, after reading the blurb on the back of the recent Wild East Productions release for this film, written by Spaghetti Western expert Tom Betts that makes note of the lack of gunplay, I was not expecting much from this film to be truthful. Within the first five minutes or so we are subjected to attempted vigilante style hanging of the poor half-American- half Mexican Chaco (George Eastman aka Luigi Montefiori) character by a family of Irish brothers who insist that Chaco had raped their poor sister. The noose is placed around the pleading, innocent Chaco's neck and the horse's backside is slapped to send it running, suddenly a gunshot rings out and shoots the rope in two and the horse races off with Chaco very much alive, the shooter being the supposed rape subject, a white woman. \n\n[...]\n\nThe director at times tended to let scenes play out too long and made for some boring, tedious parts, the editing needed to be more focused on the cutting of some scenes, like the celebration in the saloon when Chaco has returned and the festival at the end which is bit laborious to sit through. The cast is uniformly good and the two leads in Eastman and Tate play off each other well as opponents, and create a nice team at the end to exonerate Chaco. The film would probably look back to the film's THE BIG GUN DOWN (1966, Italy), RUN, MAN RUN (1968, Italy, Spain) as its models, the fun loving Mexican who is wrongly accused and it takes an Americano to help free him from prosecution. The film while having an Italian star in George Eastman has no bankable or known American actor in the film, which would point to this film as being produced for the Italian and some third world markets, Tom Betts had this to say about the film's possible distribution \"Yes these films were made for distribution in third world countries and Eastern Europe, Latin America was just starting to shrug off the oppression they felt from the British, America, and the U.S.S.R., Robert Woods told me his Pecos character was almost worshiped as a hero in African countries. They were also shown in the smaller theaters in Italy's small towns where the political content the producer, distributor, writers wanted to get over to the public by disguising it as a western.\"\n\nThe film thoroughly surprised me and was all in all a very enjoyable film presentation.The [Bastardo, vamos a matar|[Chaco]] film is an anamorphic widescreen presentation and includes a picture gallery and an alternative credits sequence. The only issues with the film presented here is that in a few scenes the blacks look a bit chalky, but that does not take anything away from this overall beautiful presentation. The soundtrack sounds great with a few small audio hisses but all in all fantastic. The fact that this hard to find film is available in a region 0 release is enough incentive to purchase, add on the beautiful presentation, and the equally beautiful presentation of THE WILD AND THE DIRTY, and you have a real winner here. This combo of films ranks right at the top in my book of region one spaghetti western releases in 2015. Thank you Wild East for this grand Spaghetti Western release.\" Written by Mike Hauss on spaghetti-western.net\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The courageous duo have run-ins with an army of Mexican soldiers, a gang of dastardly bandits, and a lethal tribe of Aztec warriors while searching the countryside for said gold fortune.\n\nReviews:\n\"Fiery blonde half-breed Yellow Hair (a winningly sassy and vibrant performance by the lovely Laurene Landon) and her easygoing cowpoke partner the Pecos Kid (a likable turn by Ken Roberson) are after a fortune in Mayan gold. The courageous duo have run-ins with an army of Mexican soldiers, a gang of dastardly bandits, and a lethal tribe of cunning Aztec warriors while searching the countryside for said gold. Director Matt Cimber, who also co-wrote the genial and eventful script with John Kershaw, relates the fun story at a steady pace, creates and sustains an engaging lighthearted tone, stages the thrilling action set pieces with gusto and competence, pays affectionate homage to the old-fashioned Western serials of yore, and further spruces things up with an amusing line in sharp cheeky humor. Moreover, the game cast have a field day with the breezy material: John Gharrari as fearsome Aztec chieftain Shayowteewah, Luis Lorento as the slimy and effeminate Colonel Torres, Aldo Sambrell as vicious mute bandit gang leader Flores, Claudia Gravy as Yellow Hair's wise Indian mother Grey Cloud, Ramiro Oliveros as mean saloon owner Tortuga, and Suzannah Woodside as brash saloon tart Rainbow. Appealing leads Landon and Roberson display a very nice and natural on-screen chemistry. John Cabrera's cinematography makes nifty use of wipes and strenuous slow motion. Franco Piersanti's spirited score hits the stirring spot.

        "Title": "Requiem for a Gringo | FREE COWBOY MOVIE | Spaghetti Western | Full Length Western Movie",
        "Description": "Full Length Western Movie: Requiem for a Gringo - A unique Euro-western with the hero as an astrologist who wears a leopard suit.\n\nRequiem for a Gringo (1968)\nDirectors: Eugenio Martín, José Luis Merino\nWriters: Arrigo Colombo, Enrico Colombo (screenplay)\nStars: Lang Jeffries, Femi Benussi, Fernando Sancho \nCountry: Spain | Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 20 June 1969 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Duel in the Eclipse \n\nStoryline:\n(1968) Lang Jeffries, Fernando Sancho, Femi Benussi, Carlos Gaddi. A unique Euro-western with the hero as an astrologist who wears a leopard suit. Sure, theres a revenge theme, but overall this is a different brand of spaghetti. Its very moody and feels like a Euro-horror film in spots. Aka Requeim for a Gringo Color, 16mm\n\nReviews:\n\"\"Requiem para un gringo\" is the kind of eurowestern that is hard to define. The main character is dressed in a Leopard suit...but he's also an Astrologist!!! Apart from that, the story is simple as in many westerns vengeance is the only point, but not the usual vengeance, I wont say much, don't want to spoil it...I gave you a clue already.\n\nL. Merino, the director, was more interested in horror and sci-fi than in westerns, maybe that is why this film looks (and works) as an horror film in many moments, which makes it much more interesting and bizarre, the dialogues are somewhat silly, but the camera work is very rich and the acting is good enough, as you can imagine the movie is full of stereotypes as it was made in Spain in the late sixties \"golden age\" of Spanish westerns. Marisa Paredes (Pedro Almodovar's favorite actress) appears in this film (at the age of 18) more beautiful than ever, but also check out for other beautiful women...\n\nMust say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. Don't miss this one if you have the chance.\" Written by bizz-2 on IMDb.com\n\n\"This movie is a lot of fun to watch. It's a riveting story with a touch of peculiarity, some great characters, and an amazing music score.\n\nThe film is a tale of justice and revenge, as a man returns home to his ranch after some sort of military service, and discovers that his brother has been killed by a gang of outlaws. The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare, but what makes this movie stand out is its style.\n\nThe main character has kind of a mystical aura about him because of his uncanny ability to predict the weather, and use it to his advantage. He also has a knack for seeming to appear out of nowhere to surprise his targets. Lang Jeffries's acting in the film is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character, but the fantastic performances by Carlo Gaddi as the slimy, menacing outlaw Ted Corbin, and the always great Fernando Sancho as Porfirio, the gang leader who is losing his grip, make up for it.\n\nThere is a very odd implementation of zoom shots in the camera work during one particular scene as the film approaches its climax. Rather than the usual sustained, intensity-building close-ups that Sergio Leone was so fond of, the director here uses a rapidly zooming in and out camera for a more unsettling effect. This turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie.\n\nThe music score is perhaps the best part of this film. The opening theme is one of my favorites, and is one of those unforgettable tunes that will play in your mind over and over long after the movie is done. The soundtrack contributes tremendously to the atmosphere of the film, especially the organ parts.\n\nThis one is a must-see for fans of the spaghetti-western genre.\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Réquiem para el gringo\nBrazil: Requiem por um Gringo\nDenmark: Messe for en Gringo\nGreece (transliterated title): Monomahia sto skotadi\nGreece (video title): Me to pistoli mou anoigo tafous\nItaly: Requiem per un gringo\nPortugal: A justiça de Gringo\nUSA: Requiem for a Gringo\nWest Germany: Requiem für Django\n Duel in the Eclipse\n Requiem for a Gringo\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

On reaching his destination - a village near the Mexican border where he is to take possession of a gold mine, he realizes that he has a neighbor, old Johnny, who owns a farm and another gold mine. He immediately sets about making his life miserable, hoping to drive him from the country and lay hands on his possessions. Lash soon becomes the undisputed master of the area, at least until Buckaroo, a wild horse tamer, arrives in town.The young man accepts to work for Johnny and, when his boss is killed in an ambush, starts gathering men with a view to fighting back Lash's army, reinforced by Monteiro and his men, who have resurfaced. After many adventures, Buckaroo gets rid of both Monteiro and Lash, in whom he has recognized the cowardly murderer of his own father.\n\nReviews:\n\"The mysterious stranger Buccaroo (Dean Reed) rides into the small gold-digger's nest New Tuscosa, only to discover that the town is dominated by the multiple mine owner Lash (great Livio Lorenzon). As you know from countless westerns, he has gotten the biggest part of his property by forcing the former mine owners into a cheap sale. The only opponent of Lash is the aging gold digger Johnny McKenzie (Ugo Sasso), who strictly refuses to give away his mine under price. But all by himself he is practically in a lost position. Help comes his way in the person of Buccaroo, who condemns Lash's bad methods and dares to stand up against his ruthless thugs. He gets support by Jean Louis, among others, who you probably know best from Barboni's Four Fists for a Hallelujah. Will they be able to withstand the pressure of the villian and what secret does Buccaroo carry inside? With Dino Strano and Gilberto Galimberti there are other well-known faces of the genre in smaller supporting roles, while Monika Brugger (Annie) and Angela De Leo provide the female charms of the film.\n\nAdelchi Bianchi's (not to be confused with Andrea Bianchi) Buckaroo - Il winchester che non perdona is solid Italo-Western material and knows how to entertain, although something more could have been made of the story. Dean Read plays his role as usual with his tongue in his cheeks and even gets to smash a few (terribly inappropriate) songs (among others \"For tomorrow I may die\"). Livio Lorenzon once again convinces as a nasty villain and the rest of the line-up does a good job, too. The musical background of Lallo Gori is fine, although I think I know some of the songs from various Fidani epics. All in all, Buccaroo - Gallows Birds doesn't offer any decent entertainment, yet without standing out from the broad, at best elevated, midfield of the genre.\n\nThe movie is rather mediocre, but can entertain adequately, has been well directed and the actors also know how to convince. Fans and collectors should strike, as this is an absolute rarity, which is now available on DVD for the first time worldwide!\" Written by BluntWolf on letterboxd.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Buckaroo (Il winchester che non perdona)\nBrazil: Buckaroo, a Winchester que não Perdoa\nFrance: Buckaroo ne pardonne pas\nGreece (transliterated title): Enas pistoli keravnos\nSpain: Buccaroo - El Winchester que no perdona\nUSA: Buckaroo: The Winchester Does Not Forgive\nWest Germany: Buccaroo - Galgenvögel zwitschern nicht\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Western Film: Black Killer - In Tombstone, a new sheriff vows to clean up the town of outlaws like the O'Hara brothers and is assisted by a strange lawyer who always carries two large law books with him. \n\nBlack Killer (1971)\nDirector: Carlo Croccolo (as Lucky Moore)\nWriters: Luigi Angelo (story), Carlo Croccolo (story) (as Charlie Foster) \nStars: Klaus Kinski, Fred Robsahm, Antonio Cantafora \nGenres: Crime | Drama | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 November 1971 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: Assassino Negro\nFilming Locations: De Paolis/INCIR Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nThe town of Tombstone is at the mercy of the five dreaded O'Hara brothers: Ramon (Antonio Cantafora), Pedro (Enzo Pulcrano), Miguel (Calogero Caruana), Ryan (Antonio Danesi)& Slide (Mimmo Maggio). An expert gunslinger, Burt Collins (Fred Robsham), arrives in Tombstone and is immediately persuaded to take on the duties of sheriff. A mysterious lawyer, James Webb (Klaus Kinski), lurking mostly in the background and occasionally joins in on the action with his deadly law books.\n\nReviews:\n\"Many spaghetti westerns had absurd gimmicks that made them memorable while at the same time subverting the iconography of their traditional American counterparts. Perhaps most famously there was Django and his coffin, in Black Killer we have Klaus Kinski's lawyer with his guns disguised as books! Like a lot of the spaghetti western gimmicks it's simultaneously completely silly and very cool. On the whole though, its business as usual spaghetti western style in this movie. We have a lawless town called, perhaps unsurprisingly, Tombstone which is terrorised by a gang of Mexican bandits called somewhat improbably the O'Hara gang. A mysterious drifter called Burt who is adept with a fire-arm comes into town and is made new sheriff by the fearful locals. The bandits subsequently kill his brother and rape his sister-in-law, an Indian called Sarah. Burt and Sarah band together, with the help of Kinski's lawyer to get revenge.\n\nTo be honest, the story-telling is a little confused and messy in this one. And it can appear a lot more convoluted than it really should do. But it ultimately is a pretty straightforward violent western. The sexual violence is fairly unpleasant, while one of the unfortunate early sheriffs is shot several times and then killed with a knife. It was good to see the character of Sarah get in on the retribution though – a female Indian with deadly skills with a bow and arrow made for a pleasant contrast to the typical taciturn gunfighter anti-hero she teams up with. Kinski is good as always as the lawyer who we can only assume the film is named after. He is in a rare good(ish) guy role in this one. He is dubbed with a silly English accent though it has to be said which is quite distracting. All-in-all though, this is a pretty entertaining spaghetti western.\" Written by Red-Barracuda on IMDb.com\n\n\"A dark, gritty and to the bone nihilistic western, that is really fun to watch. By all means one of the cheaper spaghetti's. But it's blessed with many cool scenes of violence, strange dialog and good old sleazzzzz. There's more than one moment of unnecessary nudity here. Don't take it to seriously though cause it's just a fun ride, and nothing more. The white horse Burt Collins rides is said to be the same horse that gets loaded in Cat Ballou. The actor Fred Robsahm is actually from Norway and he's currently residing in a small town called Lillesand.\" Written by bluejuice-1 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Black Killer\nBrazil (reissue title): O Pistoleiro Negro\nBrazil: O Matador Negro\nCanada (English title): Black Killer\nChile: Black Killer\nGreece (transliterated title): Katazitoumenos gia 1000 fonous\nPortugal: Assassino Negro\nRomania: Ucigaşul în negru\nSlovenia (DVD title): Crni morilec\nSlovenia: Crni ubijalec\nSpain: El pistolero de negro\nUK: Black Killer\nWest Germany (cable TV title): Black Killer\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Crni ubica\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Length Western Movie, English, Spaghetti Western: They Call Him Cemetery - John and George McIntire are a couple of naive brothers who travel to a lawless western town to see their father.\n\nThey Call Him Cemetery (1971)\nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo (as Anthony Ascott)\nWriter: Enzo Barboni (as E.B. Clucher)\nStars: Gianni Garko, William Berger, Christopher Chittell \nGenres: Western | Comedy \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 9 June 1972 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Bullet for a Stranger \n\nStoryline:\nJohn and George McIntire are a couple of naive brothers who travel to a lawless western town to see their father. The bumbling siblings get themselves into big trouble after they beat up a member of a gang of extortionists. Fortunately, a mysterious roving gunfighter decides to help the guys out of their jam. Written by Woodyanders\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"George (likable John Fordyce) and John McIntire (the equally engaging Chris Chittell) are a couple of naive brothers who travel to a lawless western town to see their father. The bumbling siblings find themselves in big trouble after they beat up a member of a gang of extortionists. Fortunately, shrewd and lethal mysterious gunfighter Camposanto (the great Gianno Garko, as smooth and charismatic as ever) decides to help the guys out of their jam by teaching them how to fend for themselves. Director Giuliano Carnimeo, working from a blithely silly and playful script by Enzo Barboni, relates the breezy story at a constant brisk pace, maintains a properly lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the wacky slapstick brawls and energetic shoot-outs with real verve (the climactic thrilling and dynamic confrontation between our heroes and the bad guys in particular seriously smokes). William Berger delivers a terrifically assured and commanding performance as crafty and deadly rival gunslinger Duke; the easy and natural chemistry between Berger and Garko makes all their scenes together a total pleasure to watch. Bruno Nicolai's rousing, twangy, and spirited score hits the stirring spot. Stelvio Massi's lively widescreen cinematography boasts a lots of crazy zooms and fierce pans. An immensely enjoyable and often amusing comedic romp.\" Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com\n\n\"This one's a keeper! Mega-stylish fun from Guiliano Carnimeo, who would also give us The Case of the Bloody Iris, one of the best gialli around. This time he's got two (camp) brothers heading from the East back to their dad's ranch, who's having trouble with an extortion racket. The brothers are absolutely crap at everything, so luckily for them dark stranger Ace (Gianni Garko) comes to their aid. Unluckily for them, the bad guys have hired William Berger to kill them.\n\nGarko shows the two fops how to mete out justice in the Wild West, while Berger sits around moodily waiting to pop a cap in their behinds. He's got this little collapsible whiskey cup, that, when folded up and put away, is a signal that someone nearby is going to shortly resemble a colander. Berger and Garko have a mutual respect for each other which is played rather nicely through the film. \n\nThere's plenty of gunfights here, a bit of slapstick, and your usual big fight at the end. If you can get over some of the broad comedy (a trend in these flicks) you'll have a good time here.\" Written by Bezenby\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Gli fumavano le Colt... lo chiamavano Camposanto\nBrazil: Eu Sou Sartana\nDenmark: Skyd først - Spørg bagefter\nFrance (TV title): Quand les colts fument... on l'appelle Cimetière\nGreece (transliterated title): Enas paranomos pou ton legane Nekrothafti\nPortugal: O Forasteiro Invencível\nSpain: Y dejaron de llamarle Camposanto\nSpain (video box title): Funeral por un colt\nSweden: En kula för en främling\nTurkey (Turkish title): Silahların Gölgesinde\nUSA: They Call Him Cemetery\nUSA: His Pistols Smoked...

        "Description": "Thunder Over El Paso - An outlaw and a bounty hunter are searching for Mexican bandit Corbancho, who is running the El Paso area, and has also robbed the Bank of Tuscon of $400,000.\n\nThunder Over El Paso (1972)\nDirector: Roberto Bianchi Montero (as Roberto B. Montero)\nWriters: Arpad DeRiso (screenplay), Maurizio Pradeaux (screenplay) \nStars: Antonio Sabato, Chris Avram, Erika Blanc \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 February 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Il était une fois à El Paso \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nAn outlaw and a bounty hunter are searching for Mexican bandit Corbancho, who is running the El Paso area, and has also robbed the Bank of Tuscon of $400,000. The bounty hunter is after the reward, while the other seek vengeance.\n\nReviews:\n\"Oh sure, as far as film goes, it's awful. But if you adore Italian produced spaghetti westerns as much as I do Roberto Montero's THUNDER OVER EL PASO (as the version I saw was titled) is pretty much everything fans of Italo Westerns watch them for. Cynical anti-heroes, offbeat locations, low-rent production values, atmospheric photography, some pretty Euro damsels ready to hop in bed with the lead actor and a healthy, bone crunching quota of violence ruthlessly dished out. Plus a compelling little musical score, this one an upbeat harmonica led folker by Carlo Savina.\n\nPolizichetti tough guy actor Antonio Sabato joins forces with Chris Avram as a pair of surprisingly vicious black hat heroes who go after a big greasy pistolero boss and his gang of cutthroats who nabbed $200,000 in gold bars. So much for the plot; The rest of the movie is an enjoyable if forgettable mish-mash of shootings, beatings, knife throwing, jail breaks, showdowns, plots, counter-plots and a few minutes cozying up with jaw droppingly beautiful Pilar Velazquez. Her pickup line \"I'm 18 and I know what I like!\" would work on me too.\n\nDirector Roberto Bianchi Montero is perhaps better known for his Giallo exploitation masterpiece SO SWEET SO DEAD and demonstrates a similar skill at moving the plot forward. The pace never drags and while nothing overtly spectacular or memorable happens the movie never pushes a wrong button. Even the requisite Torture Scene is over & done with without much fuss, and interestingly is inflicted by the protagonists rather than on them. Here are two guys who'd waterboard somebody without thinking about it, the only difference between themselves & the villain being that they get to score with the leading ladies.\n\nOne interesting aspect about the film is that it's pretty much an all Italian affair with no imported big-name Yankee star. Then again by 1972 the Italians no longer felt the urgency to have a recognizable name for the American markets and just got on with the business at hand of making their movies. Also for a 1972 spaghetti western it is notable for not having a comedy formula ala the Trinity films, and instead focuses squarely on the juvenile fantasy & violence angle. Good show!\" Written by Squonkamatic on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): I senza Dio\nFrance: Il était une fois à El Paso\nGreece (transliterated title): Makrya ap' ton Theo\nNorway: Minnesota joe\nPortugal: Os Sem Deus\nSpain: Yo los mato, tú cobras la recompensa\nUSA: Thunder Over El Paso\nUSA: Sentence of God\nUSA: The Godless Ones\nWest Germany: Rache in El Paso\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Professionals for a Massacre - Caught selling stolen guns, three Confederate soldiers get a reprieve from the firing squad, provided they go into Mexico on a mission to recover stolen gold belonging to the Confederacy.\n\nProfessionals for a Massacre (1967)\nDirector: Nando Cicero\nWriters: Roberto Gianviti (story), Jaime Jesús Balcázar (story) (as Jesus Balcazar) \nStars: George Hilton, Edd Byrnes, George Martin\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Western\nRuntime: 1h 28min\nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nFilming Locations: Cinecitta, Rome, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nHilton, Martin and Byrnes are three bandits who have joined the Southern ranks during the Civil War. They're caught selling guns to the Union and are sentenced to a firing squad. A general saves their lives at the last minute, offering them a chance at freedom by retrieving a fortune in gold. Supervised by a Confederate officer they go in pursuit, but there are dangerous competitors in the field.\n\nReviews:\n\"Dynamite-loving ex-priest George Hilton, Edd \"Kookie\" Byrnes, and Mexican horse thief/whisperer George Martin both fight for and steal from the Confederacy. About to be executed for their thieving ways, they're given a reprieve in order to track down a renegade officer who killed some of his fellow soldiers and made off with a wagon full of gold and a Gattling gun.\n\nA fast-paced, rowdy adventure, this above average Italian western is a load of fun, especially George Hilton's character, who gleefully mixes piousness with his passion for blowing things (and people!) up. Hilton is truly a spaghetti western treasure!\n\nThings stay pretty light-hearted throughout, with a good mixture of tongue-in-cheek comedy, plot-twists, and great action sequences. I don't know about everyone else, but I thought it was pretty cool!\n\nIt is claimed that one of the producers on this was a young Sylvester Stallone, a claim that seems a bit fishy. You never can tell though. If he did, he should have acted in it too. It sure would have been neat to see him before he was a star, shooting a six-gun in the Spanish desert!\" Written by FightingWesterner\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Professionisti per un massacro\nArgentina: La hermosa mas matanza del mundo\nAustralia: Professionals for a Massacre\nAustria: Stoßgebet für drei Kanonen\nBelgium (French title): Professionnels pour un massacre\nBelgium (Flemish title): Beroepsspelers voor een bloedbad\nBrazil: Profissionais da Matança\nCanada (English title): Professionals for a Massacre\nChile: La hermosa mas matanza del mundo\nFrance: Professionnels pour un massacre\nGermany (DVD title): Ein Stoßgebet für drei Kanonen\nGreece (transliterated title): Kokkino aima... kitrino hrysafi\nGreece (reissue title): Poly aima gia poly hrysafi\nGreece: Κόκκινο αίμα... κίτρινο χρυσάφι\nGreece: Πολύ αίμα για πολύ χρυσάφι\nHong Kong (Cantonese title): Gwai ma sam hung\nHong Kong (Mandarin title): Gui ma san xiong\nHong Kong (English title) (informal literal title): Ghost Horse Three Heroes\nItaly: Professionisti per un massacro\nJapan (Japanese title): 黄金無頼\nNetherlands: Beroepsspelers voor een bloedbad\nNew Zealand (English title): Professionals for a Massacre\nPortugal: Os profissionais para um massacre\nRomania: Profesioniştii pentru un masacru\nRomania: Sânge roşu, aur galben\nSouth Africa (English title): Professionals for a Massacre\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Кровь - красная, а золото - жёлтое\nSoviet Union (Russian title) (transliterated title): Krov' - krasnaya, a zoloto - zholtoye\nSpain: Los profesionales de la muerte\nSpain (alternative title): Rojo de la sangre y el amarillo del oro\nSweden: Mexicos heta guld\nSweden (alternative title): 3 Vilda desperados\nTurkey (Turkish title): Profesyonellerin dönüşü\nUK (TV title): Professionals for a Massacre\nUSA: Professionals for a Massacre\nVenezuela: La hermosa mas matanza del mundo\nWest Germany: Stoßgebet für drei Kanonen\n 3 vilda desperados\n Red Blood Yellow Gold\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Western for free: Bounty Hunter in Trinity - The townsfolk of Trinity decide to hire a notorious bounty hunter to protect them from a fierce band of Mexican outlaws who are terrorizing the area.\n\nBounty Hunter in Trinity (1972)\nDirectors: Oscar Santaniello (as Oskar Faradine), Joe D'Amato (uncredited)\nWriters: Joe D'Amato (as Aristide Massaccesi), Romano Scandariato\nStars: Jeff Cameron, Enzo Pulcrano, Attilio Dottesio \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 December 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: A Bounty Killer for Trinity \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nThe townsfolk of Trinity decide to hire a notorious bounty hunter to protect them from a fierce band of Mexican outlaws who are terrorizing the area. He discovers the true person behind the bandits is within the town. A bloody gunfight ends the control of the gang and returns control of the town to its people.\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"A BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is a grim, dark, violent little movie which turned out better than it probably had to be. This is another one of those ultra low budget Italian Westerns filmed on the ramshackle sets & familiar gravel pit owned and made by genre star Gordon Mitchell with his own resources and bare hands that served as the backdrop for about three dozen similar efforts made between 1970 and 1973 or so, a story that is actually more inspiring than the interchangeable threadbare plots of the films themselves.\n\nDirectors like Joe D'amato, Miles Deem, Frank Kramer and Anthony Ascott used the sets and outdoor locations like a Holodeck, creating worlds & places out of nothing. Costs were kept at a minimum with friends or co-workers pitching in with production crew work or bit parts, with a \"stock\" cast of actors brought in to fill the speaking roles. This week someone would play the gunslinger, next week they would be the Padre or maybe a crooked sheriff.\n\nA BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is actually one of the better efforts, with \"Jeff Cameron\" cast as a laconic, remorseless and highly efficient bounty killer hired by the scheming bigwigs of a tumbleweed nowhere to rid their budding community of some local Banditos who have the run of the place and are making their lives miserable -- see also Corbucci's NAVAJO JOE and TOM HORN with Steve McQueen for other examples of this premise. As with most Euro Westerns the lead anti-hero is armed with a clever killing contraption (ala Sabata's shotgun pistol) and this time it is a crossbow, with throwing knives, Derringer pistols, a sawed off shotgun, as well good old six shooters & Winchester repeaters also coming into play depending upon what would make a better shot. Here is an equal opportunity minded hired assassin.\n\nJeff Cameron is very good in the lead, bringing a sense of quiet disappointment and weariness about having to kill another bunch of sadistic brutes, with an ending that is actually rather evocative of DIRTY HARRY -- He takes no pride in his actions (unlike a wisecracking Sartana or ultra-cool Clint Eastwood), carries a sheaf of wanted posters for reference to make sure he is killing the right people and what the going rate is for their heads, and mastered the ability to roll a cigarette using tobacco tucked into a vest pocket for his performance. The film still has the comic book mentality of a good Anthony Ascott Spaghetti, but the affair is tinged with an air of regret for the loss of life, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that usually has a gleeful, sadistic attitude about violence and death.\" Written by Squonkamatic on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Un bounty killer a Trinità\nBrazil: Matem Trinity\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Един ловец на глави в Тринита\nEurope (English title) (literal title): A Bounty Killer for Trinity\nGreece (video title): Gia mia houfta katharmata\nUSA: Bounty Hunter in Trinity\nWest Germany: Kopfgeld für einen Killer\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Free Western Movie: More Dollars for the MacGregors - Forsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger\n\nMore Dollars for the MacGregors (1970)\nDirector: José Luis Merino\nWriters: Arrigo Colombo, Enrico Colombo \nStars: Peter Lee Lawrence, Carlos Quiney, Malisa Longo \nGenres: Drama | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 September 1970 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Death Seeks a Man \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nForsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger. When the game backfires, and she is killed, he sets out in pursuit, but a mysterious rider joins the chase. \n\nReviews:\n\"George Forsyte (Carlos Quiney) is a notorious bounty killer who is doing his best to earn a grand total of half a million dollars before retiring.  He specialises in setting traps for his victims, drawing them in by using his wife Gladys (María Mahor) as bait, pretending that she’s an innocent on the road carrying plenty of easily purloinable cash; and when he catches them, he shows no mercy, killing them with his trademark technique of a bullet in the forehead.  Things go badly wrong, however, when he tries to bring in vicious killer Joe Saxon (Vidal Molina).  Distracted momentarily by a poisonous snake, he allows Saxon to escape and Gladys is murdered as a result.  Naturally enough, he wants to have revenge, but this doesn’t work out either: before he can get to him Saxon is killed – and the reward on his head is collected – by another bounty hunter called Robert MacGregor (Peter Lee Lawrence).\n\nWhile Forsyte spends time licking his wounds, MacGregor sets off to capture another villain, Ross Steward (Stan Cooper).  Steward and his men are hiding out in the hills, where they’re forcing the local Indians to mine salt, but MacGregor’s initial efforts to locate him result in him being badly beaten and left for dead.  Nursed back to health by tasty squaw Yuma (Malisa Longo), he finds his work has become further complicated by the reappearance of Forsyte, whose motivations have become even less clear following his wife’s death.\n\nIn fact, for the first forty minutes or so it all works very well, but then it shifts focus with the death of Joe Saxon at about the forty minute mark.  At this point Forsyte fades rather into the background – until the final stages of the film at least – and the less defined Macgregor, who had hardly featured previously, takes centre stage.  Several new characters are also introduced, including the erratic Steward and the Indians (who look like nothing so much as escapees from a hippie festival), which acts to defuse the mood and ambience which had developed so nicely. In effect it plays like two parts of a TV series joined together into a feature length production, which raises the question as to whether this was intentional or whether one of the stars was perhaps unavailable for some of the filming and the script had to be adapted at the last moment.

        "Description": "Find a Place to Die - An outcast Confederate soldier redeems himself by defending a woman against bandits willing to kill for her goldmine claim. \n\nFind a Place to Die (1968)\nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo (as A. Ascot)\nWriters: Lamberto Benvenuti (screenplay), Lamberto Benvenuti (story) \nStars: Jeffrey Hunter, Pascale Petit, Giovanni Pallavicino \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 20 June 1969 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Find a Place to Die \nFilming Locations: Ostia Studios, Ostia, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nAn outcast Confederate soldier redeems himself by defending a woman against bandits willing to kill for her goldmine claim.\n\nReviews:\n\"When a man is partially buried in an avalanche, his younger wife rides to the nearest town, bringing back a handful of dubious characters to the couple's gold mine, which happens to be in the middle of land controlled by a very dangerous bandit known as Chato.\n\nNo doubt inspired in part by Henry Hathaway's classic Garden Of Evil, Find A Place To Die stands apart from other Italian westerns in that it's dark and very atmospheric, without any of the flamboyant flourishes typical of the genre.\n\nSet south of the border, this looks great with lots of rugged mountainous terrain, thick wooded areas, and crumbling Spanish architecture. They all add a lot to the movie's afore mentioned atmosphere.\n\nSadly, Jeffrey Hunter (who died the following year) is remembered by most people these days only as the predecessor to Captain Kirk in the original pilot episode of \"Star Trek\". Western fans though, know him as one of the great unsung anti-heroes in such films as The Proud Ones and The Searchers.\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com\n\n\"Though somewhat standard \"gang hunts for gold\" spaghetti western fare, it is well-directed and has solid performances. The score is also well-done, one of the better non-Morricone ones I've heard. Fast-paced with several nice action scenes, with a couple of great, cold-blooded sudden shootings. The VCI DVD is ok, letterboxed but the transfer is soft and rather noisy throughout, with a lot of grain in dark scenes. The mono sound, though, is rich and well-recorded.

On the run from Jurago, a former partner he has crossed, Clint accepts Johnny's help, and agrees to surrender ..... for now.\n\nReviews:\n\"Fans of Italian Western will know Gianni Garko (aka Gerry Hudson) as Western Hero Sartana in many of his later movies. The first scene with the wonderful Fernando Sancho will remind you on Sartana but this time Gianni Garko will be another main Character. In \"Per 100,000 dollari ti ammazzo\" he is Johnny Forest (in some alternate Version round the world Django) a man who was accused to have killed his father by his brother. After years in prison he became a bounty hunter and his brother an outlaw. Johnny Forest chases his brother. The background to the Cain/Abel story is set place during the civil war. There are several interesting scenes including brutality of war and melodramatic sequences. As there are some flashback scenes and some atmospheric scenes in a ghost town. These flashbacks are the highlights of this movie and important for the story of the main characters. Overall the music score is very good but in the flashback scenes a bit too overwhelming.\n\nIf you are looking for Westerns from Italy with lesser Action but more Story and atmospheric scenes \"100.000 dollari di ammazzo\" should be for you.\" Written by lostinaction on IMDb.com\n\n\"Nice Italian Western with sad atmosphere ,full of feeling ,wonderful musical score and special appearance by the great Fernando Sancho . This is a very entertaining SW from Giovanni Fago and the prolific western and horror screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing¨ deals with two brothers hate until death since one of them killed their father. [...] Johnny Forest, tries to carry out his mother's dying wish that he brings in his outlaw brother, Clint, alive. On the run from Jurago, a former pal he has betrayed , Clint accepts Johnny's help, and agrees to surrender . But his lover ( Claudie Lange))is kidnapped and Forest seeks vengeance .\n\nAcceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual Ernesto Gastaldi, splendid cinematography by Federico Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi. It's a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios, as invincible and tough antiheroes, difficult and fast showdowns with numerous deceases, impulsive and quick zooms, lots of action, musical score with Morricone influence .\" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Per 100.000 dollari t'ammazzo\nBrazil (reissue title): Promessa de Sangue\nBrazil: Pistoleiros em Conflito\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Убийство за 100 000 долара\nChile: Tu cabeza por mil dólares\nFinland: Kosto veressä\nFrance: Le jour de la haine\nGreece (transliterated title): Kremaste tous ektos nomou\nItaly: Per 100.000 dollari t'ammazzo\nPortugal: A Vingança É Minha\nSweden (alternative title): Hämnden är ljuv\nSweden: 100.000 dollar för att döda\nUSA: Vengeance is Mine\nUSA: $100,000 for a Killing\nWest Germany: Django der Bastard\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): Potera za 100 000 dolara\n For One Hundred Thousand Dollars for a Killing\n One Hundred Thousand Dollars Per Killing\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "REVENGE (aka JOSHUA) Free Full Blaxploitation Western Movie, English, Classic Feature Film",
        "Description": "Joshua The Black Rider: Full Free Blaxploitation Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: Joshua (1976), Drama. Joshua is a 1976 American film directed by Larry G. Spangler. The film is also known as Black Rider, Joshua the Black Rider or Revenge.\n\nIn this post-Civil War Western, Fred Williamson stars as a vigilante on the hunt for the men who killed his mother. First titled The Black Rider.\n\nA black soldier returns from fighting for the Union in the Civil War only to find out that his mother has been murdered by a gang of white thugs. He becomes a bounty hunter, determined to track down and kill the men who killed his mother.\n\nDirector: Larry G. Spangler (as Larry Spangler)\nWriter: Fred Williamson (story and screenplay)\nStars: Fred Williamson, Cal Bartlett, Brenda Venus\nRuntime: 1h 30min\n\nA low budget and lower aspirations do in this underplotted 1976 western, in which Fred Williamson does a passable imitation of Clint Eastwood, managing about 40 words of dialogue in the whole film. Larry Spangler directed, with more mismatched shots than are forgivable, even in these liberal times. PG, 75 min.\n\nSynopsis: Back from fighting for the Union in the Civil War, a black soldier becomes a bounty hunter to exact revenge on the white thugs who killed his mother.\n\nDAVID F. WALKER: Some evil racists make the mistake of killing Civil War veteran Joshua’s (Fred “the Hammer” Williamson) momma. In the process of killin’ Momma Hammer, they also kidnap the wife of the white man that she worked for. Now, I don’t need to tell you Joshua ain’t givin’ a rusty shit ‘bout the wife of no white man; but as anyone who’s seen ORIGINAL GANGSTAS knows, Fred ain’t havin’ that abuse of his momma. And quicker than you can say, “Don’t be messin’ wif my momma”, our main man sets out on a trail-o-revenge. Joshua tracks them no good varmints across the open prairie; and one by one he makes sure they all contract a serious case of the deaths. One sucka gets took out with a rattlesnake, one gets spear chucked, others get filled fulla lead, and one gets blown to smithereens. It all sounds pretty exciting…but it isn’t.\n\nLike director Jack Arnold’s BOSS NIGGER (which also starred Williamson), JOSHUA draws much of its inspiration from the European-produced spaghetti westerns, which had been popular in the 1960s, but by the 1970s had become increasingly dependent on comedy to keep the genre going. While BOSS NIGGER is a technically poor film, it is fun to watch, coming across like a blaxploitation version of Enzo Barboni’s TRINITY films. JOSHUA, on the other hand is reminiscent of spaghetti westerns from the mid-to-late 1960s, playing like a Franco Nero or John Garko film – something along the lines of MASSACRE TIME or VENGEANCE IS MINE, neither of which are all that good in their own right. But even by the standards of mediocre-to-crappy spaghetti westerns, JOSHUA isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, lacking the visual flare that fueled even some of the more craptacular Eurowesterns. While not being brain-melting terrible, JOSHUA ain’t exactly good either.\n\nThe Hammer is the only saving grace to the film, but he doesn’t keep the film moving the way Charles Bronson propels the similar CHATO’S LAND. And pretty much all the moving this film does is at a turtle’s pace, thanks in part to Larry Spangler’s flat, uninspired direction. Spangler also produced Williamson’s first western, THE LEGEND ON NIGGER CHARLEY, and he wrote, produced, and directed the sequel THE SOUL OF NIGGER CHARLEY (neither of which comfortably rest in the realm of what might be considered “decent” films). But beyond Spangler’s lifeless direction, we also have Williamson’s script, which takes no chances and gives no dimension to the hero. And while a dimensionless hero may be somewhat acceptable, flat and stale villains can really weigh a movie down, which is just another part of this sorry state of affairs.\n\n#freemovies #moviesonline #fullwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Trigger Happy AKA The Deadly Companions - An ex-army officer accidentally kills a woman's son and tries to make up for it by escorting the funeral procession through dangerous Indian territory. \n\nThe Deadly Companions (1961)\nDirector: Sam Peckinpah\nWriters: Albert Sidney Fleischman (screenplay) (as A.S. Fleischman), Albert Sidney Fleischman (novel) (as A.S. Fleischman)\nStars: Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, Steve Cochran \nGenres: Adventure | Western \nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 10 July 1962 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: New Mexico \nFilming Locations: Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA \n\nStoryline:\nThe Civil War Yankee sergeant Yellowleg saves the cheater Turkey from hanging after a card game, and together with Turk's gunslinger buddy Billy Keplinger, they ride together to Gila City with the intention of heisting a bank. When other bandits rob a store, Yellowleg shoots at the outlaws and accidentally kills the son of the cabaret dancer Kit Tilden and the grieving woman decides to bury her son in the town of Siringo in Apache country where her husband is buried. Yellowleg Enlists Billy and Turkey to escort Kitty and the coffin through the dangerous land.\n\nReviews: \n\"Peckinpah's first feature film is an understated, yet solid, Western. The film stars Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on The Westerner television series) as \"Yellowleg\", a gunman who escorts a dancehall girl (O'Hara) across the desert in order to bury her recently deceased son alongside the boy's father. Their journey is complicated by unfriendly Indians as well as Yellowleg's treacherous partners (played by Chill Wills and Steve Cochran). This movie has an excellent cast, beautiful scenery and a good story. Although Sam Peckinpah declared himself dissatisfied, \"L'office des communications sociales du Canada\" gave this movie a (3) rate, which means \"very good\". That's perfectly just. Unfortunately, it's not disponible on video. But sometimes it's diffused on TV. Just last night, the CFCF channel showed this film and so I taped it. So if ever you see this movie, don't miss it.\" Written by Mort-13 on IMDb.com\n\n\"It's time this movie took its rightful place in Peckinpah's career. Some discussions of the director don't even mention it, and I suspect that's partly because of its relative unavailability. At least it needs to be seen before making generalizations about his treatment of women, as O'Hara's character is his only strong dramatic female character (echoed later by Stella Stevens' good-time gal in the whimsical Ballad of Cable Hogue). It also shows his gentle, lyrical side in a serious context, which is an important counterweight to the brutality he's famous for. And it might provide a point of entry for those who otherwise find his work off-putting.\" Written by princehal on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\nAustria: Gefährten des Todes\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Смъртоносна компания\nBrazil: O Homem Que eu Devia Odiar\nBrazil (reissue title): Parceiros da Morte\nCanada (English title): The Deadly Companions\nDenmark: Hævneren fra Gila City\nSpain: Compañeros mortales\nFinland: Preerian laki\nFinland (Swedish title): Präriens lag\nFrance (literal title): Les compagnons de la mort\nFrance: New Mexico\nGreece: Ehthroi mehri thanatou\nGreece: Εχθροί Μέχρι Θανάτου\nItaly: La morte cavalca a Rio Bravo\nMexico: Obsesión de venganza\nPoland: Niebezpieczni kompani\nPortugal: Companheiros da Morte\nRomania: Companionii mortali\nSweden: Hämnaren från Gila City\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Опасные попутчики\nUSA (reissue title): Trigger Happy\nVenezuela: La muerte cabalga en Río Bravo\nGermany: Gefährten des Todes\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Western Movie: Django, Prepare a Coffin - A gunfighter forms a gang of \"deceased\" execution victims to get revenge on the politician and outlaw who killed his wife. \n\nDjango, Prepare a Coffin (1968)\nDirector: Ferdinando Baldi\nWriters: Franco Rossetti (story), Franco Rossetti (screenplay) \nStars: Terence Hill, Horst Frank, George Eastman \nGenres: Western | Action \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 5 July 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Get the Coffin Ready \nFilming Locations: Elios Film, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA mysterious gunfighter named Django is employed by a local crooked political boss as a hangman to execute innocent locals framed by the boss, who wants their land. What the boss doesn't know is that Django isn't hanging the men at all, just making it look like he is, and using the men he saves from the gallows to build up his own \"gang\" in order to take revenge on the boss, who, with Django's former best friend, caused the death of his wife years before.\n\nReviews:\n\"Here is a early film of Terence Hill as Django, the legendary machine-gunning mystery man always bent on revenge. This is a terrific film and the best Django since the original with Franco Nero. Terence Hill plays the part perfectly & along with a very good cast. Django had always been one of my favorite western characters. The character is always so dark and without the pretentiousness that some westerns have at times. If you like westerns that are dark & all about revenge you will really enjoy this. The soundtrack is great with the usual belting out of \"DJANGOOOO!!!\" that you'll find in various songs that are in the other 857645645645645 Django movies. If you ever find a copy of this film pick it up for sure, it is almost impossible to find these days.\" Written by AriSquad on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Preparati la bara!\nAustralia: And Now Prepare Your Grave\nAustralia (poster title): Nobody Returns...

        "Description": "A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die - In Tuscosa, New Mexico, the Governor offers amnesty papers to all outlaws but gunfighter Clay McCord's appearance triggers a violent confrontation between the local marshal, McCord, and other outlaws.\n\nA Minute to Pray, a Second to Die (1968)\nDirector: Franco Giraldi\nWriters: Louis Garfinkle, Ugo Liberatore\nStars: Alex Cord, Arthur Kennedy, Robert Ryan\nGenres: Action | Crime | Drama | Thriller | Western \nRuntime: 1h 57min\nCountry: Italy | USA\nLanguage: English\nFilming Locations: Spain\nAlso Known As: Dead or Alive\n\nStoryline:\nWhen outlaw Clay McCord learns the Governor of New Mexico has offered an amnesty to all who apply for it at the town of Tuscosa, he is intrigued but suspicious. He circles the vicinity, weighing the offer and encountering other outlaws, all the while troubled by occasional \"spells\" resembling the epileptic fits which plagued his father. Eventually McCord reaches Tuscosa where he clashes with the local marshal, Roy Colby. The Governor then arrives and tries to calm the situation, knowing that if McCord asks for amnesty, other outlaws will follow. Events lead to a shoot-out with McCord, Colby, and the Governor on one side while a band of outlaws comprise the other.\n\nReviews:\n\"Alex Cord stars in this beautifully-photographed Spaghetti Western about a gunfighter with an arm that goes into epileptic fits under pressure. After a local town decides to give amnesty and $50 to gunfighters that give themselves up, Cord strongly considers giving up his run-n-gun lifestyle. But of course there's bounty hunters, bandits and lawmen who don't exactly take a liking to that so Cord is gonna' need a lot of bullets. The action sequences are average for a Spaghetti (good guy shoots a bunch of times, bad guys throw their arms straight into the air and spin around) but the direction is quite good and the storyline is intriguing.

        "Title": "Doc, Hands of Steel | OLD COWBOY MOVIE | Free Western | Full Length Movies | Free YouTube Movie",
        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Doc, Hands of Steel - Spaghetti Western - Doc McGregor, former surgeon become player, is wrongly accused of murder and pursued by Slade, a bounty hunter.\n\nDoc, Hands of Steel (1965)\nDirector: Alfonso Balcázar\nWriters: Alfonso Balcázar (screenplay), Alfonso Balcázar (story) \nStars: Carl Möhner, Luis Dávila, Fernando Sancho\nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 January 1967 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 10.000 dólares vivo o muerto \nFilming Locations: Fraga, Huesca, Aragón, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nDoc McGregor, former surgeon become player, is wrongly accused of murder and pursued by Slade, a bounty hunter. In his escape he finds Larry Kitchener's corpse and decides to impersonate him. But his problems get worse as Kitchener was a famous gunslinger hired as sheriff for the people from Baldosas to stop Reyes, a Mexican bandit who has terrorized them.\n\nReviews:\n\"Romolo (Guerrieri) Girolami - director of classics like Johnny Yuma and 10.000 dollari per un massacro - is listed as assistent-director and one wonders if he was responsible for this more violent ('more italian') nature of the movie.\n\nCarl Möhner is Doc, a former surgeon turned drunkard and gambler with a price on his head. A bounty hunter called Slade is on his trail, but Slade has never seen his face. To confuse Slade, Doc adopts the name of a dead man who went by the name of Kitschner and was known for his golden guns. In a small western town Doc is now taken for a famous gunslinger and offered the job of sheriff. He accepts the offer, mainly because he has an eye on a local beauty, but now the bandits who have killed Kitschner, think the man with the golden gun is still alive ...\n\nA bit slow and predictable at first, the story picks up in the second half with a few plot twists and a flamboyant performance by Fernando Sancho as a sadistic Mexican bandit who enjoys shooting unarmed people, including women and children. The script is a nice variation on the doppelgänger motiv, with Mohner as the man who eventually starts identifying himself with the person whose name and fame he has stolen, becoming a better person in the process: the swindler really becomes the sheriff and the defender of the townspeople and also uses his neglected skills as a surgeon in the film's redemptive finale.\n\nNo less than four people contributed to the script and they all seem to have pushed forward their own ideas. As a result the narrative is meandering, with some story elements developed better than others, but at least the busy plot will have you guessing what will happen next. The movie is by no means great, but it's one of those minor genre entries that are easy to enjoy. The part of the intellectual turned cardsharp turned sheriff suits Möhner well and Davila is solid as the man on his trail who eventually becomes his deputy in the border town. The Italian title, L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro/The man with the golden gun, might have been a reference to Edward Dmytryk's Warlock, an very popular film in Mediterranean countries and released as L'homme aux colts d'or (The Man with the Golden Guns) in France and under similar titles in other countries. Even the idea of the duo of gunslingers coming to a western town to restore law and order might have been taken from Dmytryk's movie.\" Written by Simon Gelten on spaghetti-western.net \n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro\nArgentina: El hombre de la pistola de oro\nBrazil: O Homem da Pistola de Ouro\nCanada (French title): Un colt pour MacGregor\nColombia: El pistolero de oro\nGreece (transliterated title): O anthropos me to hryso pistoli\nJapan (Japanese title): 殺し屋がやって来た\nSpain (working title): 10.000 dólares vivo o muerto\nSpain: Doc, manos de plata\nSweden: Mannen med den gyllene pistolen - Hämnare för dollar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Silah namustur\nUSA: Doc, Hands of Steel\nUSA: The Man Who Came to Kill\nUSA: Man with the Golden Pistol\nUSA (alternative title): The Man with the Golden Gun\nWest Germany (video title): Mad Mexican\nWest Germany: Der Mann, der kam, um zu töten\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "The Shooting (Western Movie, Full Length, JACK NICHOLSON, English) *free full westerns*",
        "Description": "Full Western Movie, Full Length Cowboy Film, English: The Shooting (original title), Rated 16, Runtime 1h 22min, Western.\n\nDirector: Monte Hellman\nWriter: Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce)\nStars: Millie Perkins, Jack Nicholson, Will Hutchins\n\nThe Shooting is a 1966 western film directed by Monte Hellman, with a screenplay by Carole Eastman (using the pseudonym \"Adrien Joyce\"). It stars Warren Oates, Millie Perkins, Will Hutchins, and Jack Nicholson, and was produced by Nicholson and Hellman. The story is about two men who are hired by a mysterious woman to accompany her to a town located many miles across the desert. During their journey, they are closely tracked by a black-clad gunslinger who seems intent on killing all of them.\n\nThe film was shot in 1965 in the Utah desert, back-to-back with Hellman's similar western, Ride in the Whirlwind, which also starred Nicholson. Both films were shown at several international film festivals but it was not until 1968 that the U.S. distribution rights were purchased by the Walter Reade Organization. No other domestic distributor had expressed any interest in the films.\n\nPLOT (Wikipedia): Willet Gashade (Oates), a former bounty hunter, returns to his small mining camp after a lengthy absence and finds his slow-witted friend Coley (Will Hutchins) in a state of fear. Coley explains to Gashade that their partner, Leland Drum (B. J. Merholz), had been shot to death two days before by an unseen assassin. The killing was possibly committed in revenge for the accidental trampling death of \"a little person\" in town, which may have been caused by Gashade's brother, Coin. Coin had inexplicably rushed away from their camp moments before the shooting death. Gashade and Coley become increasingly paranoid, and Gashade takes his friend's gun away from him.\n\nThe following day, a young woman (Perkins) shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that it appeared to be perfectly healthy. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them.\n\nThe young woman is rude and insulting to both Gashade and Coley. She refuses to tell them her name. The three stop briefly in Crosstree. Gashade learns that Coin was seen there only a day or two before. As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black, Billy Spear (Nicholson), who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.\n\n...\n\nThe woman rides her horse hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse to the woman and Gashade allows Coley to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without Coley. She and Spear demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon.\n\nThe three see a bearded man (Charles Eastman) sitting in the middle of the desert nursing a broken leg. The man tells the woman that the person she is seeking is only one day's ride away. She leaves him a canteen of water. Meanwhile, the bearded man's lost horse is found by Coley. He mounts the horse, and rides back to the group. He charges Spear. Spear shoots him dead. Gashade buries his friend in the sand.\n\nAll of the horses die. The group runs out of water, but they still keep moving. Gashade sees Spear growing weaker and attacks him. After knocking him unconscious, Gashade grabs a large rock and crushes the killer's gun hand. Gashade walks after the woman, who is now closely following a man up the side of a rock formation. The man turns around and Gashade sees that the man is his look-alike brother, Coin. Gashade attempts to tackle the woman as she pulls out a gun and takes aim at Coin, but it is too late: Coin and the woman shoot each other dead. Gashade, lying next to the woman's corpse, whispers, \"Coin.\" Spear stumbles aimlessly under the hot sun.\n\n\n************\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "The Reward's Yours... The Man's Mine - A group of killers seek out wanted gunman El Puro for the $10,000 dollar reward.\n\nThe Reward's Yours... The Man's Mine (1969)\nDirector: Edoardo Mulargia (as Edward G. Muller)\nWriters: Fabrizio Gianni (screenplay), Fabrizio Gianni (story) \nStars: Robert Woods, Aldo Berti, Marc Fiorini \nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 December 1969 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: El puro \nFilming Locations: Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA group of killers seek out wanted gunman El Puro for the $10,000 dollar reward. Their target, a drunkard and fed up with living, is roused to action after they murder his girlfriend, Rosie.\n\nReviews: \n\"\"La taglia è tua... l'uomo l'ammazzo io\" (1969), more commonly known as \"El Puro\", is a Spaghetti Western directed by Edoardo Mulargia. The plot is straightforward: the once infamous gunfighter \"El Puro\" (played by Robert Woods) is now a drunkard hunted by bandits for the $10,000 reward on his head. This looks to have been cheap to make, with limited interiors which are used quite a lot. But these sets look fairly realistic as they are filthy and grubby which gives in an authentic touch of the West. The camera-work by Antonio L. Ballesteros is mainly devoid of style, apart from a few crash-zooms. The editing is rough and hasty, with more than a few jarring cuts. The direction is more spirited, with a well staged gunfight and an excellently handled climax and manages to make some of the more slower scenes interesting enough at least to watch instead of skipping them and getting to the highlights. The acting is good in places, even if Robert Woods performance as \"El Puro\" is slightly disappointing after seeing his great role in \"Black Jack\" (1968), but Mario Brega, Marc Fiorini (as Ashborn Hamilton Jr.) and Maurizio Bonuglia acquit themselves well to there roles as the villains of the picture. All in all, you should enjoy it if you are a fan of the genre.\" Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): La taglia è tua... l'uomo l'ammazzo io\nBrazil: El Puro - O Procurado\nBrazil: Pecos Acerta as Contas\nFrance: El Puro, la rançon est pour toi\nSpain: El Puro se sienta, espera y dispara\n El puro\n The Reward's Yours...

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Bad Kids of the West - Spaghetti Western - Andrea Balestri has dubbed himself Kid Terror O’Hara, leader of a group of children who head to the ghost town of Torque to play cowboy games.\n\nBad Kids of the West (1973)\nDirector: Tonino Ricci\nWriters: Mario Amendola, Roberto Amoroso \nStars: Andrea Balestri, Cristiana, Mirko Ellis \nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 4 December 1975 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Little Kid und seine kesse Bande \nMusic: Enrico Simonetti\nSong: “La banda del West” sung by Renata Cortiglioni\n\nStoryline:\nAndrea Balestri has dubbed himself Kid Terror O’Hara, leader of a group of children who head to the ghost town of Torque to play cowboy games.\nOne day, he overhears a gang of outlaws planning a bank robbery in River City, his hometown. As a game, and as part of an attempt to be taken more seriously by the adults in town, Kid Terror O’Hara decides he and his friends will rob the bank themselves.\nIn a complex plan that includes diversions, padded wagon wheels, explosives made from gunpowder and butter, and smuggling the smallest child into the bank in a piece of luggage, the children succeed.\nThey hadn’t counted on the outlaws looking for revenge once they realize someone got to the gold before they did.\nNor had Kid Terror and his friends quite figured out how they would tell the town sheriff what really happened at the bank. \n\nReviews:\n\"Give this film a chance, and you might be pleasantly surprised. I went into it with empty gun expectations and wound up laughing more than at the far majority of the Spaghetti West comedies.\n\nSome of the humor is crude. Offering the outlaws warm beer, Kid Terror has the child with the weakest bladder slip behind the bar and pee in two mugs.\n\nBut there are some genuinely clever moments — and dialogue — too. These kids have more moxie and ingenuity than they know what to do with.\n\nThere’s also a subplot with lots of familiar faces. A corrupt businessman named Wilson (Franco Ressell) is trying to squeeze farms off their land by not extending a loan to their leader, McKenzie (Attilio Dottesio).\n\nFortunato Arena plays the sheriff trying to sort through all the trouble in town.\" Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Kid il monello del west\nAustria: Little Kid und seine kesse Bande\nDenmark: Vestens skræk\nGreece (transliterated title): Mikroi diavoloi... o tromos tou West\nSpain: Los pequeños coyotes de Kid O'Hara\nSweden: Westerns skräck\nUSA: Bad Kids of the West\nUSA: Kid, Terror of the West\nUSA: Western Kid\nUruguay (video box title): Kid, el travieso del oeste\nWest Germany: Little Kid und seine kesse Bande\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Assault on Fort Texan - Spaghetti Western - During the Civil War, a group of confederate soldiers with the help of Apache Indians, try to defeat a Union fort, while trying to gain support from Emperor Maximillian of Mexico. \n\nAssault on Fort Texan (1965)\nDirector: Alberto De Martino (as Martin Herbert)\nWriters: Alberto De Martino (as Herbert Martin), Eduardo Manzanos (screenplay) (as Silver Bem)\nStars: Edmund Purdom, Paul Piaget, Mónica Randall \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Spain | Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 21 May 1965 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 7° de caballería \n\nStoryline:\nThe year is 1863. And while the Civil War rages back east, a Confederate regiment is trying to make its way through Texas to Mexico. Problem is, the Union 5th and 7th cavalry are blocking the escape route.\n\nSo the Confederates, using Col. George Bonnett (Eduardo Fajardo) as an intermediary, form an alliance with Apache Chief Wild Horse.\n\nThe plan is simple: Wild Horse’s warriors will attack a nearby settlement, luring the Union cavalry out of the protection of the fort. Then more Indians will attack the undermanned fort.\n\nAnd that strategy works to perfection, leading to the annihilation of the 5th Cavalry. Defeating the 7th with the same plan might not be as easy,\n\nThe 7th has a reliable junior officer in Maj. Sam Allison (Paul Piaget). And he’s counting on an assist from reluctant Maj. Sugar Patterson (Edmund Purdom), who’s time in uniform is almost up and who would rather be drinking and womanizing than soldiering.\n\nAt least until a pretty Indian girl named Amanda (Monica Randall) catches his eye. Then there’s a question of what to do with the pretty saloon singer named Nelly (Ida Galli). As harmless as she looks, could she really be a Confederate spy? Written by Mark Franklin\n\nReviews:\n\"Take the Civil War, add a horde of marauding Apache, two lovely ladies and a pair of large-scale cavalry vs. Indian battles, and you should be able to put together an entertaining Western.\n\nUnfortunately, this film is too silly too often to be taken the least bit seriously.\n\nTake the stagecoach robbery that opens the film. A gun battle breaks out in which everyone is killed but the stage driver, the shotgun guard and two female passengers. One of the females says everyone is dead; they might as well get going. And they do, leaving the heroic male passengers lying dead in the dust with the bandits!\n\nIt’s a sign of things to come. Later, the commander of the Union fort dies in a scene that must be seen to be believed. Then, during his funeral ceremony, a warning bell rings. Indians are attacking a nearby settlement; it might be wiped out.\n\nToo damn bad, decides the new commanding officer. The ceremony will go on, regardless of how many settlers are being massacred just short charge away.\n\nPaul Piaget plays the straight-laced officer who gives that order, but Maj. Sugar Patterson is the star of this show. He’s a lovable rogue who opens the film in the guardhouse, for insubordination, of course.\n\nHe’s decorated his cell with drawings of shapely women and his time of service is about to run out. But he keeps finding himself being drawn back into the action, both out of self-preservation and a sense of duty.\n\nOne night, he heads out to scout an Indian village with Piaget’s character. Moments later, he’s kissing one of the prettiest little Indian squaws you’ll ever find in a Spaghetti Western.\n\nTurns out she’s named Amanda. And later on, she plays guitar as a ruse so her new girlfriend Nelly can escape from Sugar.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: More Dead Than Alive - Cowboy Movie - Released from prison after 18 years, notorious gunslinger 'Killer' Cain is a peaceful reformed man but the Old West has died and he cannot adapt to the modern West where some unpaid moral debts and old troubles resurface. \n\nMore Dead Than Alive (1969)\nDirector: Robert Sparr\nWriter: George Schenck\nStars: Clint Walker, Vincent Price, Anne Francis\nGenres: Romance | Western \nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 12 June 1969 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Mais Morto que Vivo \nFilming Locations: Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park - 4730 Crystal Springs Drive, Los Angeles, California, USA \n\nStoryline:\nWhen the multiple murderer Cain is released from prison after 18 years, he wants to settle down as a rancher and never touch a gun again. But his former life haunts him; not only that nobody wants to give him a job, some villains also want to pay him back. So he has to accept the offer of showman Ruffalo to perform as \"Killer Cain\" in his traveling shooting show. However after 18 years without practice even Ruffalo's young assistant Billy shoots better than Cain.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is a most peculiar western film. Clint Walker plays the role of Cain, a man released from prison after a 20 year sentence. The passing of time is touched on when Cain sees many new inventions such as a bicycle. His reputation seems to follow him everywhere he goes, and he can't hold a job very long. His only choice is to exploit his past evil life, and join a wild western shooting show run by a showman named Ruffalo, played by Vincent Price. I would recommend this film to any film fan that enjoys strange or Avant Garde Films. Price seems to believe that he is in one of his American International (AIP) horror roles like House of Usher or Pit and The Pendelum. The acting plays as if each actor believes they are in a different film. The movie was released by United Artists in 1968. It is not available on VHS or DVD, but it does show up on TV from time to time on Encore Westerns. I believe that MGM owns the United Artist catalog. They should restore this film and release it as part of their Avant Garde cinema series.\" Written by Tony Rome on IMDb.com.\n\n\"The bottom line is that \"MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE\" (1969, Sparr) is a really good film. Clint Walker is wonderful as always playing gentle giant Cain, murderous outlaw turned humble man; Vincent Price is great (... of course) as Dan Ruffalo; Anne Francis is very sympathetic as Monica; and Paul Hampton is solid as the annoying and cocky little sharp shooter with much to learn.\" Written by TCurtis9192 on IMDb.com.\n\n\"This is a western with great direction and a very good cast. It's not your run of the mill shoot'em up. I saw this movie many years ago and have not forgotten it. I have searched high and low for it, but, cannot find a copy anywhere. It's worth the watch!\" Written by dixiecarson on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Clint Walker fans won't be disappointed, and I love the ending. Vincent Price seems to be having a great time in his role, and although Mike Henry is underused, he does a great job with his small, but important role, playing one of the villains. Hampton looks the part, but tends to overact a little (though not to the extent some have said) and ultimately he does well. I would rather have seen a tougher-looking guy in his role, such as Dean Smith, but it's not that big an issue.\" Written by Johnboy1221 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): More Dead Than Alive\nBrazil (cable TV title): Mais Morto do Que Vivo\nBrazil: Mais Morto que Vivo\nCanada (English title): More Dead Than Alive\nCanada (French title): Plus mort que vif\nDenmark: Mere død end levende\nFinland (informal title): Enemmän elävä kuin kuollut\nFrance: Plus mort que vif\nGreece (transliterated title): Monomahia sto Paolo Doble\nHungary: Életre-halálra\nItaly: Meglio morto che vivo\nNorway: Mer død enn levende\nPortugal: Mais Morto que Vivo\nRomania: Mai mult mort decât viu\nSpain: Más muerto que vivo\nSweden: Mer död än levande\nTurkey (Turkish title): Canlıdan çok ölü\nUK: More Dead Than Alive\nUSA: More Dead Than Alive\nVenezuela: Más muerto que vivo\nWest Germany: Killer Cain\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: I'll Die for Vengeance - Spaghetti Western - A Mexican gang headed by vicious Pedro terrorizes the land between New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nI'll Die for Vengeance (1968)\nDirector: Tanio Boccia (as Amerigo Anton)\nWriters: Tanio Boccia (as Amerigo Anton), Mario Moroni\nStars: Kirk Morris, Larry Ward, Sergio Ciani \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 10 March 1968 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: I'll Die for Vengeance\n\nStoryline:\nA Mexican gang headed by vicious Pedro terrorizes the land between New Mexico and Arizona. Jeff a youth whose father has been killed by Pedro seeks revenge.\n\nReviews:\n\"I'll Die for Vengeance is the third of four spaghetti westerns directed by Tanio Boccia, the man who gave us the very enjoyable Kill the Wickeds. In his home country Boccia is known a man who could do miracles with small budgets; some of his movies are said to be awful, some really good: Kill the Wickeds is often called his best movie, this one is no doubt among the worst.\n\nItalian muscle man Kirk Morris (birthname: Adriano Bellini) is Jeff, a young cowboy whose best friend is killed by a gang of pissed-off Mexican bandits who are on the way back from a failed bank robbery (everything went well, but the safe was empty). Jeff himself is wounded but nursed back to health by a friedly family of farmers. Jeff applies for the job of deputy sheriff in a border town, so he can shoot the Mexicans legally when they cross the border. But there are a few complications: The Mexicans have an accomplice in town, a criminal mastermind who’s the architect of all their activities. He is known by the name of Saguaro (which is also the alternative title of the movie) but nobody has ever seen his face ...\n\nAccording to Marco Giusti this movie is a remake, in western form, of a peplum movie called Sansone contro i pirati, also starring Morris and also directed by Boccia (*1). Sansone is Samson in Italian, but apparently the film was not set in Biblical times, but in the Carribean, anno 1630. In this remake the Carribean has become the American-Mexican border and the pirates have become bandidos launching their attacks on horseback. Some Cucaracha-kind-of-music is played every time they ride out and when they’re spotted in the distance, women and children quickly seek shelter, crying: The Mexicans are coming! The Mexicans are coming! I wouldn't like to accuse Boccia of racial prejudice, but subtle it ain’t. Anyway, what might have worked in a pirate movie (\"The pirates are coming!\" seems a logical reaction when the black flag is spotted in the distance) doesn’t work here.\n\nChunky muscle man Morris looks like a younger, more muscular version of Hoss Cartwright. The film has a bit of everything: fistfights, romance, murder, mayhem, even an under water scene (no doubt a relic of the pirate days of the movie). On the plus side we get a brief but tickling flagellation scene involging a señorita with a well-shaped back. Gordon Mitchell has an entertaining cameo as a black-clad cardsharp with bleached hair, but I had no idea what he was doing in the movie, apart from being shot and blowing up a few opponents with dynamite.\n\nForgettable stuff, for completists only.\" Written by Scherpschutter on spaghetti-western.net\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Sapevano solo uccidere\nBrazil: Somente Sabia Matar\nFrance: Seul contre les mercenaires\nGreece (transliterated title): Ixeran mono na skotonoun\nUSA (complete title): I'll Die for Vengeance\nWest Germany: Mein Leben für die Rache\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Silver Lode - Cowboy Movie - In Silver Lode, Dan Ballard is arrested by 4 Marshals for murder and theft but he denies the charges and searches for the real culprit even as the townsfolk start abandoning him. \n\nSilver Lode (1954)\nDirector: Allan Dwan\nWriters: Karen DeWolf (story), Karen DeWolf (screenplay)\nStars: John Payne, Lizabeth Scott, Dan Duryea\nGenre: Western \nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 4 March 1955 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Stad i panik \nFilming Locations: Republic Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA \n\nStoryline:\nDan Ballard, a respected citizen in the western town of Silver Lode, has his wedding interrupted by four men led by Fred McCarty, an old acquaintance who, as a US Marshal, arrests Ballard for the murder of his brother and the theft of $20,000. Ballard seeks to stall McCarty while tracking down evidence that will prove his innocence: but the townspeople's loyalty to him gradually begins to waver under McCarty's accusations.\n\nReviews:\n\"The action starts with Dan and three other riders (Harry Carey Jr and Alan Hale Jr for gosh sakes... you know you're in for a good time) riding into the town of Silver Lode on forth of July. They're looking for the man named \"Dan Ballard\" but everyone they ask gives them the cold shoulder, one remarks they know a gunfighter when they see one. Turns out Dan is a federal marshal named Ned McCarty (other reviews have noted the McCarthy similarity and I agree with them on that) come to take Ballard -- solidly played by John Payne -- prisoner back to California for a murder rap. The victim is, it turns out, McCarty's brother and there is also a matter of $20,000 stolen at the same time.\n\nAt first the town's people are solidly behind Ballard but gradually they come around to bow McCarty's assumed authority and turn against Ballard. This is done rather well, not nearly as heavy handedly as might be. Many reviewers have noted the similarity to \"High Noon\", it's sort of a \"High Noon\" in reverse. While that's mighty high company the comparison is not out of line and the wonderful direction of Allan Dwan makes up for the lower production values. This is a good story, well made and worth looking for.\" Written by smorrow2-1 on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Some have claimed how \"impossible\" it is not to compare this with \"High Noon\". I haven't seen \"Noon\" in years but this film was fresh in every way. Just to think of it - here is a collaborator with D. W. Griffith who has made more films during his successful career than any ten directors combined - and many of them Westerns! He was wowing audiences with his technical know-how long before \"High Noon\" was a twinkling in anyone's eye. How much the villain and McCarthy have in common is more in the domain of the scriptwriter than the director, perhaps - after all, the scriptwriters got the shaft more often than anybody else during the witch hunts. This is a lively tale and it moves quickly. The colors are wonderful and the tracking shots vivid. Come to think of it, I might just prefer it. It doesn't talk itself to death, but neither do the other Dwan films I've seen over the years.\" Written by cstotlar-1 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Silver Lode\nAustria: Stadt der Verdammten\nBelgium (French title): Noces rouges\nBelgium (Flemish title): Rode bruiloft\nBrazil: Homens Indomáveis\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Сребърната жила\nCanada (English title): Silver Lode\nDenmark: Liv for liv\nFinland: Ratsastavat hurjat\nFinland (Swedish title): Ridande desperados\nFinland (Swedish title) (TV title): Stad i panik\nFrance: Quatre étranges cavaliers\nGreece (transliterated title): Sklavoi tou misous\nItaly: La campana ha suonato\nJapan (Japanese title): 逮捕命令\nNetherlands: Amok in Silver Lode\nNorway: Desperate menn\nPoland: Co się zdarzyło w Silver Lode\nPortugal: Falsa Justiça\nRomania: Silver Lode\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Серебряная жила\nSpain: Filón de plata\nSweden: Stad i panik\nTurkey (Turkish title): Kanlı düğün\nUK: Silver Lode\nUSA (working title): Desperate Men\nUSA (working title): Four Desperate Men\nWest Germany: Stadt der Verdammten\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Zlatna zica\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: The Last Traitor - Spaghetti Western - Ned Carter is waiting with a bunch of guests for his bride. When they notice there are exactly 13 people at the table, an unlucky number, some think it's an evil omen. \n\nThe Last Traitor (1971)\nDirector: Giuseppe Vari (as Joseph Warren)\nWriters: Adriano Bolzoni (screenplay), Ted Rusoff (additional dialogue)\nStars: Donald O'Brien, Maurice Poli, Dino Strano \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 12 March 1971 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: 13e est un traitre \n\nStoryline:\nDonald O’Brien is Ned Carter, a former Confederate officer who returns to Sonora at the end of the Civil War and invites all his friends to celebrate his wedding to Mary Bell Owens.\n\nThen one of the guests notice there are 13 people gathered around the dinner table, waiting for Mary Bell to arrive by stage from El Paso.\n\nSure enough, it’s a bad omen. When the stage arrives, all three postal guards are dead. So it Mary Bell, sitting inside the coach, a bullet between her eyes.\n\nCarter, of course, vows vengeance. But before he can act, three of his guests — the Ross brothers — are killed in an explosion.\n\nLooking for answers, Carter and his allies call on Judge Stump. They find him hanging from a beam in his home.\n\nMeanwhile, two of Carter’s wedding guest have gone missing. They include an explosives expert named Joe and a gambler named Tim.\n\nThen comes the rumor that the silver mine Carter expected to inherit with his wedding might contain $200,000 in hidden Confederate gold.\n\nAnd pretty saloon girl Emilia might complicate matters, because she’ll flirt with anyone if it gets her closer to that money.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is a 'mash-up' as the kids say of Western and Gialli, with all the suspects a bunch of tobacco chewing gunslingers already gathered in one place as the film begins. These fellows are waiting in the village of Sonora for the arrival of bride to be Mary Bell, daughter of a recently deceased mine owner, and her groom is grizzled Donald O'Brien, who has gathered his buddies together.\n\nOne buddy, a dodgy priest (I mean he's not trustworthy, not 'dodgy priest' by today's standards) notices that there a thirteen at the table, and that in these gatherings, the thirteenth guest is always a Judas. We then discover that everyone here is a bit nasty, from the murderous brothers to Maurice Poli's card shark to the crooked judge. Things turn very suspicious when the bride arrives in the carriage, killed to death by murder! And those three corpses with her - they're not mere postal workers - them's federal agents!\n\nGoshdarnit - We have a good old murder mystery on our hands, and one of the thirteen is a murderer. It actually turns out to be fourteen people if you count the constantly changing allegiance of local girl Emelia, but don't dwell on that too much. No one can trust anyone else, and there's plenty of secrets to be revealed before the usual gunfight (it being a Western at heart, really, at the end of the day once all is said and done, when you think about it upon reflection, amen).\n\nI didn't mind the old double crossing and the people being murdered and such like. There isn't much gore or violence and both Maurice Poli and Donald O'Brien aren't the most emotive actors to appear in these films, but the whole thing plays like a late sixties giallo with twists and reveals right up until the end, when the word 'fine' flashes on screen, informing us the whole film was fine, but not great.\" Written by Bezenby on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Il tredicesimo è sempre Giuda\nFrance: 13e est un traitre\nFrance: Le treizieve... un traitre\nItaly: Il tredicesimo è sempre Giuda\nNorway: Den siste sjansen\nNorway (alternative title): Forræderen\nUSA (informal literal English title): Thirteenth Is a Judas\nUSA: The Last Traitor\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Sons of Trinity - Spaghetti Western - The Trinity legend continues when the sons of Trinity and Bambino head out on the road to continue the legendary hijinks of their fathers. \n\nSons of Trinity (1995)\nDirector: Enzo Barboni (as E.B. Clucher)\nWriter: Marco Barboni\nStars: Heath Kizzier, Keith Neubert, Yvonne de Bark\nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain | Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 April 1996 (Germany) \nAlso Known As: Ein Begräbnis und die Auferstehung der vier Fäuste \nFilming Locations: Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nThe Trinity legend continues when the sons of Trinity and Bambino head out on the road to continue the legendary hijinks of their fathers.\n\nReviews:\n\"Sons Of Trinity was directed in the mid-1990's by the late Enzo Barboni, the same director of the early 1970's Trinity movies 'They Call Me Trinity' and 'Trinity Is Still My Name'\n\nSons Of Trinity features the Sons of the original characters of Trinity and Bambino, in yet another comedic spaghetti western. The sons have the same names as their fathers, the same looks, the same personality and mannerisms, the same quirks, etc... It still works quite well and has the same basic elements as in the original movies.\n\nShot in Spain and featuring two American actors in the lead roles of Trinity and Bambino, this was in stark contrast to the two leads in the original Trinity films played by Italian actors with fake Americanized names.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed Sons Of Trinity. It isn't quite as good as the original movies, but it is still quite entertaining!\" Written by Katatonia on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Shrewd, but laid-back Trinity (amiable Heath Kizzier) and the burly, hot-tempered Bambino (the equally engaging Keith Neubert) are the sons of a pair of notorious troublemakers. The nice guy drifter duo come to the aid of a peaceful small town that's being terrorized by an evil gang of bandits. Writer/director Enzo Barboni delivers a good-natured comedic outing that unfolds at a steady pace, maintains a disarmingly lightweight tone throughout, and offers plenty of amusingly silly and inoffensive humor (a lively and protracted last reel outburst of rough'n'ready fisticuffs is especially sidesplitting). The likable and relaxed chemistry between appealing leads Kizzier and Neubert really keeps the picture humming. The fetching Yvonne De Bark further enlivens the proceedings with her radiant portrayal of the sweet Bonita. Moreover, there are neat supporting turns by Renato Scarpa as the benign Pablo, Siegfried Rauch as tough horse rancher Parker, Ronald Nitschke as a bald, hard-nosed sheriff, Renato D'Amore as grimy no-count outlaw Ramirez Primero, and Jack Taylor as stuffy rich jerk Theopolis. Both the crisp cinematography by Juan Amoros and the twangy, harmonic score by Stefano Mainetti are up to par.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Blood at Sundown - Spaghetti Western - Twelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend.\n\nBlood at Sundown (1966)\nDirector: Alberto Cardone (as Albert Cardiff)\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi (story), Vittorio Salerno (story) \nStars: Anthony Steffen, Gianni Garko, Erika Blanc\nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy | West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 28 July 1967 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Blood at Sundown\nFilming Locations: Elios Film, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\nTwelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend. Now the town's undisputed boss and doted over by his possessive mother, Sartana seems safe - until, his sentence served, Johnny rides back into town.\n\nReviews:\n\"Steffen and Garko have been in a lot of awful movies, no doubt about that, so \"Sartana\" can easily be considered a climax in their careers, respectively.\n\nIt's the story of two brothers fighting each other, Steffen playing the straight and honest one, Garko portraying a sadistic, screaming blond loony. Their mother tries to stop him. Intense pictures, intense emotions, the director even alluded to Shakespearean tragedies a few times, but you needn't take that too seriously. All in all, well done, spaghetti western above average.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Decent and morally upright Johnny Liston (an excellent and sympathetic performance by Anthony Steffen) gets out of jail after serving twelve years. He vows to get revenge on his evil and ruthless despot brother Sartana (robustly played with deliciously vicious aplomb by Gianni Garko), who framed Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend Manuela Holt (lovely Angelica Ott). Director Alberto Cardone, working from a dark and uncompromising script by Ernesto Gestaldi and Rolf Olsen, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, does an expert job of creating and sustaining an extremely tough and gritty tone, milks the potent sibling rivalry theme for all it's worth, and stages the rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs and stirring shoot-outs with considerable gusto. Steffen and Garko do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive able support from Erika Blanc as the fiery Joselita, Robert Miali as hapless browbeaten mute Jerry, Carla Calo as the bitter, boozy Rhonda Liston, Franco Fantasia as the weak, ineffectual sheriff, Sieghardt Rupp as the nasty Ralph, and Carlo D'Angelo as the crooked, slippery Judge Waldorf. Gino Santini's sumptuous cinematography offers plenty of bold and startling compositions (the sweeping panoramic shots of the dusty and desolate desert are especially striking and impressive). Michele Lacerenza's twangy and harmonic score likewise hits the flavorsome spot. But it's the film's remarkably hard and harsh no-nonsense mood which in turn gives this movie an extra jolting edge: the villains are truly hateful and sadistic, the outbursts of violence are quite savage and shocking (even women and children aren't spared from the copious brutality), and the climactic bloodbath is both wild and exciting.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Up the MacGregors - Spaghetti Western - The Macgregor family is back and this time they have their women with them, in the hunt for the men who have stolen their gold. \n\nUp the MacGregors (1967)\nDirector: Franco Giraldi\nWriters: Fernando Di Leo (story), Enzo Dell'Aquila (story)\nStars: David Bailey, Hugo Blanco, Alberto Dell'Acqua \nGenres: Comedy | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English \nRelease Date: 14 June 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 7 Mulheres para os MacGregor \nFilming Locations: Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nThe Macgregor family is back and this time they have their women with them, in the hunt for the men who have stolen their gold. \n\nReviews:\n\"The families of MacGregor, who has 7 sons, and Donovan, who has 7 daughters, are next door neighbors in the Wild West. When bandits steal the treasure of the Mac Gregors, the sons go to retrieve it. The story is rather simple, mainly an excuse for many fights, including the pretty ladies who are not to be underestimated. The families' parties after the fights, however, are almost as dangerous as the fights were! But the strength of this sequel to \"7 Guns for the MacGregors\" is that it is never as silly as later Italian western comedies in the 70s, because the action scenes are well staged, edited and photographed, for example the fight on the locomotive is something any serious western movie would be proud of. Editor Nino Baragli previously did nothing less than \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". Also the villain (Leo Anchoriz) is portrayed quite seriously, some brutal scenes - for example when he shoots some of his gang members - are not what you'd expect in a comedy.\n\nIt's the combined qualities of the comedy and action scenes that make this movie great fun from the first to the last minute. Most people praise this sequel less than the first movie \"7 Guns for the MacGregors\", but for me, it's absolutely on the same quality level, just like the Morricone soundtrack.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"This is not a well-regarded example of the spaghetti genre, but for my money it's pretty good and is certainly entertaining. In this outing, the evil Maldonado (Leo Anchoriz, channeling the spirit of Timothy Carey) steals the MacGregor family gold, and it's up to the seven brothers to reclaim it. The film consists of wall to wall action, all of it extremely well-staged, and Alejandro Ulloa's cinematography is outstanding. The incessant theme song returns from the first film (Seven Guns For the MacGregors) but thankfully it isn't overused quite as much this time. Also of note is the return of actor Victor Israel as a traveling dentist--he played the morbid pianist in Seven Guns--and also that of beautiful Agata Flori, who reprises her role as Rosita, the wife/fiancée of brother Gregor (Another World's David Bailey, replacing Robert Woods). If you've only ever seen this in pan and scan or on a bootleg, splash out for a copy of the Ripley Home Video PAL disc--as with their release of Seven Guns, the transfer is near flawless. It may not be art, but it sure is fun.\" Written by JohnSeal on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 7 donne per i Mac Gregor\nBrazil: Sete Mulheres para os MacGregor\nDenmark: MacGregors!

        "Title": "Pecos Cleans Up | WESTERN MOVIE in Full Length | Classic Cowboy Film | English | Free Movie",
        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Pecos Cleans Up - Spaghetti Western - Three musicians arrive in a Mexican village destroyed by El Supremo and learn, from the only survivor, of the lost treasure of Montezuma hidden in an Aztec temple. Along comes Pecos and the search is on.\n\nPecos Cleans Up (1967)\nDirector: Maurizio Lucidi\nWriters: Adriano Bolzoni (screenplay), Augusto Caminito (screenplay) \nStars: Robert Woods, Erno Crisa, Luciana Gilli \nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 8 December 1967 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Döden rider bredvid \n\nStoryline:\nThree mariachi performers stumble upon a ranch being raided by El Supremo’s henchmen. They watch as every man and woman is killed.\n\nThe raiders are looking for a map to the lost treasure of Montezuma. They don’t find it, but after they’ve left the scene of the crime, the mariachi performers do — hidden in a pigeons’ pen.\n\nAh, but there’s a problem. The temple that El Supremo has turned into a hideout is precisely where the treasure is hidden. And they have no chance of penetrating a temple guarded by El Supremo’s small army of henchmen.\n\nThen they meet a seemingly indestructable fast gun named Pecos Martinez (Robert Woods). He’s willing to take on the challenge. After all, there are 30 pounds of hidden gold buried in the caverns beneath the temple.\n\nReviews:\n\"Apart from the dreadful south American dubbing of my DVD I must admit that PECOS CLEANS UP (AKA Pecos and the treasure of Moctezuma) is a good way to spend 90 minutes, if you are into Spaghetti westerns this one is a exotic rarity that you don't want to miss.\n\nImagine the only descendant of Moctezuma who rules a gang of ruthless bandits and lives inside an Aztec pyramid craved on a lost canyon, that's the villain...now imagine that the lost gold of Moctezuma is somewhere in a cave and our hero (and three mariachis) are the only ones who knows where to find the treasure, there's also a map and a bunch of soldiers...strange story for a western? sure, but it works fine and is also a movie for the entire family, not much violence, total absence of sex, some funny jokes and bloodless shootouts make the movie suitable for kids and probably they will enjoy it a lot.\" Written by bizz-2 on IMDb.com.\n\n\"A sequel to 1966’s “My Name is Pecos,” this film has a lighter tone. In fact, it’s only connection to the earlier film is the presence of Robert Woods as Pecos Martinez.\n\nIt’s not as good either, as Pecos almost effortlessly eliminates El Supremo’s band of ruffians, frees two women — Dona Ramona and Eliza — who are being held captive and discovers the lost gold with amazing ease.\n\nIf you’re looking for clever, Pecos does use the weak spots of El Supremo’s lieutenants to eliminate them and his men. So Dago dies partly as a result of his gluttony, “Frenchie” because of his lust and El Rayo (Lighting) because of his greed.\n\nOf course, it all leads up to a showdown between the rope/whip wielding El Supremo, who dreams of controlling all of Mexico, and Pecos, who only wants to get rich. He’s even willing to share with his mariachi friends.\" Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Pecos è qui: prega e muori!\nBrazil: Pecos Vem para Matar\nDenmark: Pecos renser ud\nFinland: Pecos tekee puhdasta jälkeä\nGreece (transliterated title): I epistrofi tou Pecos\nJapan (Japanese title): 虐殺砦の群盗\nNorway: Pecos rydder opp\nSpain (DVD title): Pecos y el tesoro de Monteczuma\nSweden: Döden rider bredvid\nTurkey (Turkish title): Pekos ölüm saçıyor\nUSA: Pecos Cleans Up\nWest Germany: Jonny Madoc rechnet ab\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: The Great Treasure Hunt - Spaghetti Western - A blind man wants to get his mitts on a crooks' gold. He can't do it alone, so he hires the quartet of soldiers-of-fortune to help him. \n\nThe Great Treasure Hunt (1972)\nDirector: Tonino Ricci\nWriters: Fabrizio Diotallevi (screenplay) (as Fabio Tallevi), Jesús R. Folgar (story)\nStars: Mark Damon, Rosalba Neri, Stelvio Rosi \nGenres: Action | Comedy | Thriller | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 7 February 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: 5 pour l'or de los quadros \nFilming Locations: Estudios Cinematografica Roma S.A., Madrid, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nAfter committing a robbery, Sam is about to be hanged. His brother Dean contacts a Frenchman (former expert in explosives) and his attractive niece (a poker player). The three put on a scheme to make a bank robbery, just in time to disrupt Sam's hanging, and free him, too. In turn, the four are hired by Felipe, a blind Mexican interested in art painting, namely some paintings that are kept by the military dictator, El Supremo. The task would be difficult already, but it's worth as the two brothers weren't fighting each other for whatever reason, and if everybody had not ulterior motives for their acts.\n\nReviews:\n\"My review is of the English-dubbed, fullscreen VHS video, released in the US in the 1980s, entitled THE GREAT TREASURE HUNT. Lovable rogue Dean Madison (played by the charming Mark Damon, always good as a lovable rogue!) enlists a French munitions expert and his \"niece\" (played by the luscious Rosalba Neri--she and Damon would be reunited the next year in DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT) to help save his brother Sam, who has just been caught while robbing a bank. After that incident is resolved, about one-third of the way into the film, a blind man named Felipe is waiting for the quartet, and explains that he was kept prisoner and tortured by a mad Mexican general who has appointed himself as \"El Supremo\" and has built an impregnable fortress which is filled with gold. He suggests the quartet work with him to get that gold, so they head toward Mexico and thus begins the Great Treasure Hunt of the title. This is not a nihilistic, bleak Italian western--it's an entertaining caper film (really not unlike OCEAN'S ELEVEN or GRAND SLAM, but in western garb), nicely shot (except for too many unconvincing day-for-night shots), and well-acted by all the principals, especially Damon and Neri. Most of the music sounds unlike typical Italian western music (except in a few scenes), sounding more like a typical USA adventure film score. There's nothing profound or incredibly original here (although the surprise ending comes off well!), but it's an entertaining Eurowestern adventure, and those who must see as many Eurowesterns as they can will want to track down this one. As it was released on video in the USA, used rental copies can probably be found. A pleasant surprise! Damon appeared in many other excellent Eurowesterns, and of course went on to great success as a producer and film executive, capacities in which he still works as of this writing (check his producer filmography to see the many hits he's been involved with!). However, he's still a star as an actor in my house, and much of his European output is still in need of rediscovery. I hope to find more in the coming years...\" Written by django-1 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Monta in sella!!

He hires a professional tracker with a reputation for finding his quarry to help him find the gang and rescue his daughter. \n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"I agree that this TV Western is worth your time. Ernest Borgnine and Sammy Davis Jr play well together. Watch fast for a young William Katt as Borgnine's son. The character of El Grande is played by the excellent Gary Marshal of Camelot (1967) and The Thousand Plane Rain (1968, released July 1969). In this production he is credited as 'Caleb Brooks'. though I do not know why. His performance is memorable and it is a shame he did not do more work on film. His career has been mostly on the stage where his considerable vocal talents have been wowing audiences for many years. Fans also remember him fondly in three episodes of Marlo Thomas' That Girl series playing British Photographer Noel Prince. He can also be viewed in the Vegas (1979) episode 'Lost Monday' as Dr Middleton as well as a cameo in George Clooney's Intolerable Cruelty. Back to the film...I have always enjoyed the music in this production and the script is above average. I can see how it would have made for an entertaining feature film.\" Written by trevoranndouglas on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Big name stars with excellent acting in this movie all add to the enjoyment of the search. Fast moving action and a couple of scenes with the heroes getting the upper hand make the movie go by too quickly. Ernie Borgnine and Sammy Davis, Jr. make a great team. Sammy's character's laid-back personality is an exciting contrast to some of the other characters' impatience and prejudice which make you keep on watching. I watched this movie twice tonight to make sure I didn't miss anything - I give it a 10 as I feel each character gave so much strength to the overall picture. Jim Davis and Julie Adams are very talented, seasoned actors and Bucklind Noah Beery was a surprise to me as I never knew Noah Berry, Jr. had a son. Buck has been in other roles I have found by searching the Internet and if he is half as good an actor as his famous father and grandfather he is worth watching.\" Written by TwinIrish on IMDb.com.\n\n\"a fine made for tv western centering on tracker(Sammy Davis Jr) aiding Earnest Borgnine in the search for his missing daughter.

First, he has a falling out with his best friend, Frank Sanders, after saving Jane, the girl he loves, from Mexican kidnappers in order to extort a ransom from her gunrunner father.\n\nThree Graves for a Winchester (1966)\nDirector: Emimmo Salvi\nWriters: James Wilde (story), Ambrogio Molteni \nStars: Gordon Mitchell, Mickey Hargitay, Milla Sannoner \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 24 July 1970 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 3 Bullets for Ringo \n\nStoryline:\nRingo Carson has a tough life. First, he has a falling out with his best friend, Frank Sanders, after saving Jane, the girl he loves, from Mexican kidnappers in order to extort a ransom from her gunrunner father. Frank goes off to the Civil War. Ringo reconciles with his estranged mother who needs his fast gun to protect her land from greedy land-grabber Daniels. Then Frank returns from...\n\nReviews:\n\"Ringo and his buddy Frank are two guns for hire, sent by a local businessman to retrieve his daughter from some pesky Mexican bandits. After shooting several hundred bandits and getting the daughter back, it turns out that Frank is in love with this chick, but she has the hots for Ringo, and they intend to marry. Following a punch up, Frank heads out of town and Ringo marries, settling down with his missus and becoming sheriff, also reconciling with his mum, who owns land that an evil banker wants at all costs.\n\nGot all that? It gets more complicated as war breaks out, Ringo gets blinded by accident and Frank takes over as sheriff in town, joining forces with the evil banker in order to get the land from Ringo's mum. When Ringo's mum gets killed and Ringo badly beaten, the blind guy goes on the warpath to bring everyone down, using his guns, his crazy friend, and a whole load of cannons and gunfire.\n\n3 Bullets for Ringo is solid Spaghetti Western madness. Every time Ringo goes into battle scores of bad guys get wasted, and there's a full on gun battle involving cannons in a cave system, and a climatic battle in town between the good guys and the bad guys, with the survivors literally stepping over all the corpses to get to each other.\n\nGordon Mitchell sure was ugly though, eh? Plus, fans of realism might want to stay away from this one though, as Ringo can gun down entire armies of bad guys without reloading or even using cover. As to be expected from an Italian film, everything looks great, especially the scene where three bad guys beat the crap out of Ringo and his family. There's also some sort of weird voodoo ceremony and the bad guys planning to roast Ringo's son over a fire. Fans of Spaghetti Westerns should track this one down. The opening credits are rather groovy too!\" Written by Bezenby on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Former hired gun Mickey Hargitay rescues his future wife from bandits, reconciles with his mother, becomes sheriff, and is blinded in the Civil War. He then finds himself clashing with a nasty banker and his old partner Gordon Mitchell, the town's new sheriff.\n\nDespite it's ultra-low budget, odd bits of humor, and very loose plot, I can't help but be entertained by this spaghetti western, in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to see overwrought muscle-men Hargitay and Mitchell chewing the scenery together in the same movie, though not nearly as much as Mickey did the previous year in the crackpot horror classic, The Bloody Pit Of Horror.\n\nThe filmmakers appear to have thrown in everything but the kitchen sink, including a Voodoo ceremony (!), actors named John Heston, and Spean Convery, and a fleeting character that appears to have been dubbed by an actor impersonating Jimmy Stewart!\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 3 colpi di Winchester per Ringo\nBrazil (DVD title): 3 balas para Ringo\nBrazil: Três Tiros de Ringo\nDenmark: Tre kugler til Ringos Winchester\nHungary: Ringo bosszúja\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Три пули для Ринго\nSweden: Winchester - Döden talar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Ringo'ya 3 el ateş\nUSA: Three Graves for a Winchester\nWest Germany: Drei Kugeln für Ringo\n 3 Bullets for Ringo\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Castellari\nWriters: Sergio Corbucci (story), Tito Carpi (screenplay) \nStars: Andrea Giordana, Gilbert Roland, Horst Frank\nGenres: Drama | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 26 November 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Johnny Hamlet \nFilming Locations: Cuenca Minera, Huelva, Andalucia, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nOn his way back from the Civil War, Johnny Hamilton is visited in his sleep by the ghost of his father who lets him know that he has been murdered and who asks him to avenge him. Back in the family ranch, Johnny finds that not only has his father been killed but that Gertrude, his mother, has married her late husband's brother Claude. The latter is now the owner of the ranch and of all the properties of the deceased. Polonius, a ruthless bandit, is supposed to have killed Johnny's father. But couldn't it be Claude...?\n\nReviews:\n\"This underrated spaghetti western, based on an idea by Sergio Corbucci and directed by Enzo Castellari of Keoma fame, sports excellent cinematography, a nice soundtrack by the recently deceased Francesco De Masi and an impressive cast. While the protagonist, played by Andrea Giordani, is the usual spaghetti 'avenging hero' fare, the highly charismatic Horst Frank and the rest of the cast do a great job. The 'Hamlet' theme injects a lot of originality into the vengeance story, the intro dream sequence being very surreal and creative. And while you will not find a deep, meaningful version of 'Hamlet' here, lots of religious metaphors are around and, along with the healthy dose of humor (which not everyone will appreciate) make this one of the more intelligent euro westerns around. Definitely recommended.\" Written by moerchi on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Based on an idea by Sergio Corbucci, Enzo Castellari directed this western adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" drama, as Django (or Johnny, depending on which dubbing you get in your country) avenges the death of his father. It is interesting to observe how the classical tragedy elements work in the context of a Mediterranean style western movie. Not yet 30 years old, Castellari was already very creative at little touches like the camera circling around Django's face in the scene at his father's grave, and should take this way further in \"Keoma\" a decade later.\n\n\"Quella sporca storia nel west\" suffers a bit from the unconvincing cast: German actor Horst Frank with his blond hair does not look like he is a member of the same family as Gilbert Roland, the veteran actor Roland is too old to play Andrea Giordana's brother, whose mother is much too young to be the mother of any of them. But even if the audience won't buy this ensemble for a family, the cruelty of the old tragedy is working great for a tough western, and the visual qualities of the movie, also gifted with a thrilling musical score by Francesco de Masi, save the day and make it a must for the collection of every spaghetti western fan. Regrettably, Andrea Giordana did not make any westerns after this anymore, because the young man had talent.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Quella sporca storia nel west\nAustria: Django - die Totengräber warten schon\nBrazil: Deus Criou o Homem E o Homem Criou o Colt\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Джони Хамлет\nCanada (English title): Johnny Hamlet\nFrance: Django porte sa croix\nGreece (transliterated title): O stavromenos tou Rio Grande\nGreece (reissue title): To moutro tou Notou\nPoland: Johnny Hamlet\nPortugal: Johnny Hamlet\nRomania: Johnny Hamlet\nSpain: Johnny el vengador\nSweden: Det kom en farlig hämnare\nUSA: Johnny Hamlet\nUSA (alternative title): The Wild and the Dirty\nUSA (alternative title): To Kill or Not to Kill?\nWest Germany: Django - Die Totengräber warten schon\nWorld-wide (English title) (informal literal title): That Dirty Story of the West\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Mallory Must Not Die! - Spaghetti Western - Retired Colonel Harper wishes to retire to his ranch, but the malicious Bart Ambler also has an interest in the property.\n\nMallory Must Not Die! (1971)\nDirector: Mario Moroni\nWriter: Mario Moroni (idea and screenplay)\nStars: Robert Woods, Gabriella Giorgelli, Teodoro Corrà \nGenres: Action | Romance | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 18 November 1971 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Django - unerbittlich bis zum Tod \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nRobert Woods – he’s Robert Wood in the credits here – is Larry Mallory, a half-breed heading West to Texas with partner Col. Todd Harper (Renato Baldini), a former Confederate officer.\n\nHarper wants to get even with a man named Bart Ambler (Teodoro Corra), who was somehow responsible for his sister’s death during the war. He plans to do that by buying a prized ranch out from under Ambler.\n\nIt’s a ranch that was once in possession of the Ambler family. It’s a ranch destined to grow in value with the arrival of the railroad. Harper completes the purchase with a wagon laden with gold via an agent named Ferguson.\n\nEnraged when learning about the deal, Bart and Block Stone kill Ferguson, steal the gold and try to buy back the ranch through legitimate means. When that doesn’t work … well, gun play ensues.\n\nBut Bart has trouble finding a gun that will be a match for Mallory, a half-breed Harper has taken on as his partner because he once saved his life.\n\nComplicating matters, Mallory finds himself falling for Ambler’s pretty sister Cora (Gabriella Giorgelli), who hates violence. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\n\"In the very earliest days of cheap VHS releases, I bought MY NAME IS MALLORY for less than ten bucks. It was the second VHS tape I picked up, the first being DAY OF ANGER under another title, GUN LAW I think. I never got around to watching MALLORY and it disappeared before I got serious about collecting spaghetti westerns. It's a good looking widescreen film, made at Elios Studios. I recognized a set from DAY OF ANGER, also used in DEATH RIDES A HORSE, the staircase in the saloon unmistakable. This one was not filmed in Ameria, Spain though, exteriors are in the countryside around Rome. Larry Mallory (Robert Woods) buys a ranch along with his partner, Col. Hasper (Renato Baldini). It used to belong to the Amblers, Bart (a very mean gunfighter, and his lovely sister Cora (the luscious Gabriella Giorgelli) and they want it back. Bart is willing to kill and steal to make it so, but Cora is innocent of his deviltry. Bart's main partner is Block Stone (shades of Dash Riprock!) played by Artemio Antonini. He's very good and reminds me physically of Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's a formidable opponent for Mallory and they have a terrific fight which leaves both men out of action for awhile. And the elusive Carla Mancini plays Maria, a maid who pours water on Cora while she's taking a bath. I believe it's one of the few identifiable roles she played. MY NAME IS MALLORY is an elusive movie, but it's worth seeking out. Robert Woods is good as always, although he sports a funky hair-cut in this one. He's a half-breed and I guess the pony tail indicates that. A solid six, spaghetti western fans will enjoy it more than non-fans.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Il mio nome è Mallory...

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Return of Django - Spaghetti Western - The son of Django searches for the murderer of his father and is thereby involved in a war between two factions headed by former acquaintances of his famous parent. \n\nReturn of Django (1967)\nDirector: Osvaldo Civirani\nWriters: Alessandro Ferraù (story), Tito Carpi (story) \nStars: Guy Madison, Gabriele Tinti, Ingrid Schoeller \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 28 March 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Fahr zur Hölle, Django\nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nOne night, retired gunfighter Django and his son Jeff Tracy are having supper in their cottage when someone knocks at the door. Django opens and a man informs him that his boss, Thompson, wants to see him. Django invites the man inside and starts putting his gun-belt on. When Django turns his back to the late-night visitor, he gets shot in the back and dies. Django's son, who is only 9 years old, witnesses his father's murder and remembers the name mentioned by the intruder, Thompson. Years later, Jeff Tracy is a grown man who is handy with his six shooter. He is on a quest to find his father's murderer and the man called Thompson who apparently ordered the killing of Django. Jeff Tracy's quest leads him to the town of Topeka where a major feud is going on between two strong men bent on taking over the whole county. One man is Clay Ferguson. The other man is Thompson. Jeff Tracy lands right in the middle of the feud and is in grave danger. Luckily, a former gunslinger and friend of Django, reformed as a priest known as Father Gus Fleming, has arrived in town. He tries to dissuade Jeff Tracy from revenge and murder. Written by nufs68\n\nReviews:\n\"I disagree with the other reviewer and to my taste this is a superior spaghetti with an off-character performance from Tinti that places him IMHO in a superior niche to anything that Richard Harrison ever did. While this is not a great spaghetti it is a competent film and many of the scenes deserve repeat viewing for interest. This movie contains all of the elements of a fine spaghetti however it is weak in significant areas relating to storyline, continuity and detail. For example, this was not a starring role for Madison. Madison should have been listed as a \"featured\" cast member, however this detail does not impact the film overall. Yes his entrance is awkward -- almost an after thought -- but he did contribute to the action and I especially liked his line about \"an eye-for-an-eye\" being different where guns and bullets are concerned! So finally this is (after all) a 1967 period spaghetti, and IMO one of the better ones. Overall I rate this movie as a solid 7 to my taste where 10 would be something like Vengeance or Keoma.\" Written by mister990 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Il figlio di Django\nBrazil: O Filho de Django\nCanada (English title): Son of Django\nDenmark: Django, ene mod alle\nFrance: Le retour de Django\nGermany (DVD title): Fahr zur Hölle, Django\nGreece (transliterated title): O gyios tou Django\nPortugal: O Filho de Django\nRomania: Fiul lui Django\nSerbia: Đangov sin\nSlovenia: Djangov sin\nSpain: El hijo de Django\nSweden: Revansch i Topeka City\nUSA: Return of Django\nUSA: Son of Django\nWest Germany: Der Sohn des Django\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): Đangov sin\nYugoslavia (Slovenian title): Djangov sin\n Vengeance Is a Colt 45\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Four Rode Out - Spaghetti Western - A U.S. marshal sets out to bring in a Mexican bandit accused of killing his girlfriend's father, but it turns out that there's more to the story than there first appears to be. \n\nFour Rode Out (1969)\nDirector: John Peyser\nWriters: Dick Miller (original story) (as Richard Miller), Paul Harrison (adaptation)\nStars: Pernell Roberts, Sue Lyon, Julián Mateos\nGenres: Romance | Western \nCountry: Spain | USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 December 1971 (Spain) \nAlso Known As: Cuatro cabalgaron \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nA U.S. marshal sets out to bring in a Mexican bandit accused of killing his girlfriend's father, but it turns out that there's more to the story than there first appears to be.\n\nReviews:\n\"\"Four Rode Out\" could have been titled, \"Four Walked Out,\"since the quartet of characters spent most of their time on foot. The horses were done with one by one in scenes that looked almost too real.\n\nIt is, to say the least, a very stark movie - slow-moving, yes, but constantly engrossing. The clown critics who gave it one star were probably affected by the hot desert sun coming through their screens, affecting their minds. Whoops - almost said brains.\n\nAs to the acting. Young Mateos as the b.f. was convincing. Sue Lyon, accused by one critic as over-acting, was quite good handling a rather complex character, one almost as naive as Lolita. (Had to get that in).\n\nLeslie Neilsen sandwiched between his early near-fame days, to steering the Poseidon into near oblivion, to good-sized stardom, seemed to have a blast as a baddie - a real baddie.\n\nPernell Roberts, Bonanza's maverick, was excellent portraying a very questionable character.\n\nThe silent ending wrapped the story beautifully. The minus was Janis Ian's contribution - totally unnecessary, totally dull.\n\nThe rest of the music was justifiably sparse. For a change, it did not blast out at you.\n\nAll in all, \"Four Rode Out\" is worthwhile. Fie on the naysayers. Give it a chance. It is sometimes frighteningly captivating.\" Written by froberts73 on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Now, I've just finished watching this film, and the first point I'd like to make is that I've never seen Leslie Neilsen in anything better. As the film requires, he's sinister, leery, violent, childish, anxious and insane as Perkington agent Brown (or is he?)...I was glued to the screen from start to finish, which is unusual for a Western that has no real gunfights.\n\nMarshall Ross heads out to bring a Mexican bandit to trial. Problem is, the bandit's girlfriend wants to tag along, as does Brown, a Pinkerton agent who merely likes to kill his clients and bring them home. The girlfriend gets concerned that Brown will kill her boyfriend, but he makes her a deal: her body for her boyfriend's life...and so begins a game of intrigue.\n\nFour Rode Out basically has four characters in it. Leslie hates everyone, wants to kill everyone, and wants everything from himself. On the other hand, Marshall Ross just wants his last assignment over and wants to go home. Fernando just wants to live a little longer and Sue Lyon's character is a sadly misguided teen who believes everything she is told...The whole drama of the affair plays out in the desert as the characters have less water and less patience.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, you will enjoy this one.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Savage Gringo - Spaghetti Western - A drifter helps a ranch couple fend off the approaches of a ruthless landowner. \n\nSavage Gringo (1966)\nDirectors: Antonio Román (as Anthony Roman), Mario Bava (uncredited)\nWriters: Jesús Navarro Carrión (story) (as Jesus Navarro), Antonio Román (story) (as Antonio Roman)\nStars: Ken Clark, Yvonne Bastien, Piero Lulli \nGenres: Action | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English \nRelease Date: 6 December 1966 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Savage Gringo \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA laconic drifter, who calls himself Nebraska, is hired as a ranch hand by Marthy Hillman and his wife Kay who are under pressure from a ruthless landowner, named Bill Carson, who extorts money from the ranchers. When Carson sets his sights on Kay, Nebraska eventually decides not to stay out of it and plans to save Hillman from Carson's men and rescue Kay.\n\nReviews:\n\"This review is of the pan-and-scan AIP-TV version of this film, called SAVAGE GRINGO. I taped it off TV about 20 years ago. I liked it then, and I like it now just having re-watched it. The few references to this film I've seen note that Mario Bava took over the direction from Antonio Roman, who is solely credited on the copy I have of this film, and then fault the film because it has few if any distinctively Bava touches in it. If you are looking for an Italian western that is to the genre what HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD is to sword-and-sandal films, look elsewhere, as you won't get it here. With so many Italian westerns having so many odd cinematic techniques used in them, SAVAGE GRINGO is actually quite conventional. Perhaps Bava simply just did a professional job on this and did NOT see it as an auteur piece on which he would put his personal stamp or with which he would make some statement about life and art. He had already worked with Ken Clark previously in ROAD TO FORT ALAMO/ ARIZONA BILL (a film which DID have a number of Bava touches to it)--perhaps that was one reason he was asked to complete this film? In any event, Clark is fantastic in this role. He is tall and athletic and one of the better American actors to work in the spaghetti western genre--it's a shame he only made two. His character NEBRASKA is fascinating although enigmatic, and creates a warmth and passion in the role. He's also VERY quick with a gun and it's exciting to see him come out of the woodwork in the blink of an eye and blow someone away. Personally, I don't have a problem with his motivations never being clearly stated--isn't that a little bit like real life? While we have a feeling that Nebraska will win in the end, we don't really know HOW he will get to that point or what barriers he will face along the way, so I don't see that as causing any lack of suspense. The suspense is caused by wondering how the situation got to the point it did--who exactly is Kay? Why does she point out that she's not married to Marty, and if not, what exactly is going on here? How did this Bill Carter get to be running things? What's Nebraska's perspective on this? In a way, the film plays against our expectations of what we expect from other films. Judged solely as a spaghetti western, NOT as a Mario Bava film, I've got to give this an above average rating.\" Written by django-1 on IMDb.com. \n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Ringo del Nebraska\nAustria: Nebraska Jim\nBelgium (Flemish title): De dollars van Nebraska\nBelgium (French title): Les dollars du Nebraska\nBrazil: Gringo Selvagem\nFrance: Les dollars du Nebraska\nGreece (transliterated title): Nebraska, o pistolero\nHungary: Gyorsabb a golyónál\nIndia (English title): Ringo Del Nebraska\nJapan (Japanese title): ネブラスカの一匹狼\nMexico: Gringo salvaje\nNorway: Revolvermannen Ringo Nebraska\nSpain (short title): Ringo de Nebraska\nSpain: Ringo de Nebraska (El rancho maldito)\nSpain: Ringo de Nebraska\nSpain (alternative title): El rancho maldito\nTurkey (Turkish title): Ringo Kanunsuzlar Diyari\nUSA (alternative title): Gunman Called Nebraska\nUSA: Ringo from Nebraska\nUSA: Savage Gringo\nWest Germany: Nebraska-Jim\n Savage Gringo\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

There she gets in a fight with another woman and tries to stab her with a knife. Arrested, she is entrusted to Don José who must escort her to the police station in town. However, clever Conchita gives Don José the slip. Because of her escape, he is demoted to private and must pull additional guard duty. One night, Conchita shows up at the fort to see Don José who's on guard duty. While she apologizes to him and seduces him, she also distracts his attention from a small group of smugglers who enter the fort. Don José is furious and goes to see Conchita at her friend's place. Unfortunately, Conchita is there with a gentleman lover, an officer. In a fit of jealousy, Don José loses his head and punches the officer who falls and dies. Don José deserts the army and runs away with Conchita. She takes him to a gypsy camp where many smugglers live. Conchita and Don José plan to save money and board passage on a ship bound for a new life in America. In the camp appears one man, former Lt. Miguel Garcia, who has just been released from prison. A shocked Don José learns that Miguel Garcia is Conchita's husband...\n\nReviews:\n\"This is an adaption of the classic novel Carmen which puts the main characters into a Spaghetti Western setting, but instead of yet another Spaghetti Western director Luigi Bazzoni created a brooding drama full of psychological tension and visually spectacular sequences. If you are looking for an action movie, look somewhere else, although the movie does contain a very well photographed chase sequence.\n\nFranco Nero again proves to be a great actor and Tina Aumont does a splendid job, too. Klaus Kinski is typecast as the crazy villain again and he again plays this part very well. Look out for the guest appearance of the Austrian Burgschauspieler Karl Schönböck!\n\nCarlo Rustichelli's score matches the movie perfectly since it's a lavish mix of operatic music and brooding low-key pieces. (Get the soundtrack CD released by CAM!)\n\nOnly a heavily cut version made it to the German cinemas and again it was tried to sell a movie as yet another adventure of Django, which is even more nonsensical if the literary source of this movie is considered.\" Written by liderc on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): L'uomo, l'orgoglio, la vendetta\nBelgium (Flemish title) (video box title): De Deserteur\nBrazil (reissue title): Django não Perdoa, Mata\nBrazil (DVD box title): Django Não Perdoa...

The bad guy is the local landlord and aristocrat (Fernando Rey), who horribly abuses the laborers in his community.\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Tight-lipped and blithely indifferent gunslinger Marco (a fine and intense Terence Hill in a refreshing change-of-pace serious role) gets hired by evil land baron Don Antonio (the always excellent Fernando Ray) to assassinate a man who's planning to start a revolution amongst the local oppressed and impoverished peasants. After finishing his assignment, Marco realizes the error of his ways and sides with the peasants to overthrow Antonio's cruel reign. Director Mario Camus, who also co-wrote the thoughtful and literate script, eschews the expected shoot 'em up formula in favor of something more lofty and ambitious: a thinking man's oater that deals with the weighty Marxist theme of how the strong and wealthy upper class make their living exploiting and degrading the poor and powerless lower class. While it sounds heavy-handed and the pace periodically drags in spots, this movie nonetheless manages to be a gripping and satisfying viewing experience thanks to the well-drawn central characters, the right-on leftist politics, and occasional outbursts of exciting and well-staged action. Kudos are also in order for the sturdy acting from a capable cast: Hill in particular excels in a meaty non-comedic lead role, plus there are praiseworthy contributions from Rey, Mario Pardo as Marco's loyal, easygoing brother and partner Jacobo, Maximo Valverde as the mean Ramon, Angel Lombarte as the hot-headed, but decent and charismatic worker's union leader Jose, Maria Grazia Buccella as feisty hotel proprietor Soledad, and William Layton as the humane Don Lucas. Roberto Geraldi's bright, picturesque cinematography does the trick. Augusto Martelli's twangy score likewise hits the harmonic spot.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Two Guns and a Coward - Spaghetti Western - Anthony Steffen, a young gunman who works as a circus performer, witnesses the killing of some outlaws carried out by their leader, is credited with the deed.\n\nTwo Guns and a Coward (1968)\nDirector: Giorgio Ferroni (as Calvin Jackson Padget)\nWriters: Giorgio Ferroni (story), Augusto Finocchi (story)\nStars: Anthony Steffen, Richard Wyler, Luisa Baratto \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 29 February 1968 (Italy)\n \nStoryline:\nAnthony Steffan plays Gary McGuire, a renown carnival show trick-shot artist nicknamed Hurricane West with a secret past.\n\nAs a boy, he fired a shot that caused a stampede. Three men were killed, including his brother. He was whipped as punishment, leaving a scar on his neck.\n\nGary perceives that scar as a sign that he should never resort to violence against another man and that there will be severe repurcussions if he does.\n\nSo while his quick draw and markmanship make him the star of a traveling circus, Gary cowers in fear when confronted with a real-life need for violence.\n\nAmong Gary’s adoring fans is an orphaned boy named Tony Murphy, who’s hoping Hurricane West might help him reclaim the family farm stolen years earlier on a night bandits raided the property, killing his father.\n\nTurns out that was part of a land grab scheme devised by a Lewistown saloon owner named Coleman and his lead gunman Roy Elroy (Giovanni Ciafriglia). What they don’t know is that Tony’s dad hid $30,000 on the farm they stole, and only Tony knows the money’s location.\n\nWhat Tony doesn’t know is that Elroy is the man who shamed Gary in front of a circus crowd, prompting him to leave the show and bury his troubles in booze. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Under the stage name \"Hurricane West\", Gary McGuire (Anthony Steffen) is a highly skilled shootist who stars in a circus act. A boy, Tony Murphy (Marco Steffenelli who is Benito Stefenelli's son) worships Gary, but Gary is actually a coward. When Al Roy (Ken Wood) and his friends humiliates Gary, he turns to heavy drinking. After Coleman (Richard Wyler) threatens to torture Tony, Gary mans up and refuses to give Coleman any information. In a later disagreement, Roy kills Coleman. Gary regains his self respect, and his circus friends help him to eliminate Roy and his criminal gang.\" Written by marthahunter on IMDb.com.\n\n\"A decent Spaghetti Western in which the hero turns out to be a coward, but needs to redeem himself if he’s going to save the life of a young friend — not to mention his own dignity.\n\nIn a neat twist early in the film, Elroy and his gang rob a sheepman heading West. When they stop to split the money, he guns down the other five gang members so he can keep it all to himself.\n\nGary has joined the posse trailing the bandits and watches all of this go down. He can’t muster the courage to draw on Elroy as he rides off with the loot. But when the other members of the posse return and assume he’s responsible for the five dead bandits, he takes credit for single-handedly wiping them out.\n\nLuisa Baratto plays Maggie, the circus performer in love with Gary. Gia Sandri is Dora, the saloon girl who learns about the hidden $30,000 and makes sure the word gets back to Coleman. Nello Pazzafini is leader of the circus in which Gary stars and Tom Felleghy is Brody, Tony’s guardian who’s nevertheless in cahoots with Coleman.\" Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Il pistolero segnato da Dio\nBrazil: O Pistoleiro Marcado por Deus\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Стрелец, изпратен от Господ\nDenmark: Skarpskytten hævner\nFinland: Kaksi asetta pelkurille\nFrance: Deux pistolets pour un lâche\nHungary (TV title): A gyáva mesterlövés\nItaly (literal English title): Gunman Sent by God\nJapan (Japanese title): 必殺の二挺拳銃\nMexico: Il pistolero segnato da Dio\nPortugal: O Pistoleiro Designado por Deus\nSpain: El pistolero que odiaba la muerte\nUSA: Two Pistols and a Coward\nWorld-wide (English title): Two Guns and a Coward\n\n····················································································\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: The Long Day of the Massacre - Spaghetti Western - A sheriff suspended for excessive brutality fights corrupt authorities, bandits and others.\n\nThe Long Day of the Massacre (1968)\nDirector: Alberto Cardone (as Albert Cardiff)\nWriters: Mario Gariazzo (story), Alberto Cardone (screenplay) \nStars: Peter Martell, Manuel Serrano, Luisa Baratto\nGenres: Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 29 August 1968 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: Hängt den Sherif\n\nStoryline:\nPeter Martell is Joe Williams, a sheriff with a knack for bringing them back dead.\n\nThat doesn’t amuse the local judge, who reminds him that even the most vicious killers deserve a trial.\n\nSo when three of Pedro La Muerte’s henchmen try to ambush Joe in his sleep, he indeed tries to bring them in alive.\n\nBut, sure enough, a gun battle breaks out. The Green brothers wind up dead. And the judge demands Joe’s badge, putting deputy Evans (Glenn Saxson) in his place.\n\nThen Pedro’s band kills two settlers in a search for Joe and manage to pin the blame on the ex-lawman. Pretty soon, Joe has a $7,000 bounty on his head.\n\nBut he still proves a problem for Pedro and his gang.\n\nWhen they rob the local bank, it’s Joe who winds up with the loot. And Pedro’s going to have a hard time getting him to tell where that gold’s hidden. Written on https://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\nTake away the seemingly endless scenes of characters riding around, the chase scenes and some very unconvincing fisticuffs, and there wouldn’t be much left to this Spaghetti Western.\n\nThere are two pretty ladies on hand. Luisa Baratto plays Joe’s girlfriend. She wants to marry so she can stop traveling from town to town with her brother Adam, selling magic elixir.\n\nThen there’s Daniela Giordano in one of her better roles as Paquita, who rides right alongside Pedro on his raids and comes up with many of the gang’s best ideas, including framing Joe and later threatening his girl with rape in order to learn where the loot is hidden.\n\nBut remember, the key plot device here is that Joe’s in trouble for dispensing law with his gun. For playing judge, jury and exectioner.\n\nThen comes the climatic massacre mentioned in the title. Guess who initiates it? That’s right, Evans, the man who replaced Joe as sheriff. Hmm.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: The Dirty Outlaws - Spaghetti Western - An outlaw masquerades as the son of a blind man in order to find a cache of gold located in a vacated town.\n\nThe Dirty Outlaws (1967)\nDirector: Franco Rossetti\nWriters: Vincenzo Cerami, Ugo Guerra \nStars: Andrea Giordana, Rosemary Dexter, Franco Giornelli\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 January 1969 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Django - Die im Schlamm verrecken \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nThe film tells the story of an outlaw who masquerades as a blind man's son in order to trick the old man out of a cache of gold located in a vacated town. A gang of bandits appears in the same town to rob a payroll coach that has to pass through and they take the blind man's gold as well, setting the desperado against the gang.\n\nReviews:\n\"A man known as \"Desperaaadooo\" to his enemies and the singer of the title song, or simply Steve (Andrea Giordana, \"Quella sporca storia nel west\") to his friends, tries to make money outside the law at the end of the civil war. He stops at nothing, even stealing it from a blind man seems not to trouble him. Nevertheless, when that old man is killed, Desperado decides to avenge his death. Not only the presence of Piero Lulli (plays the blind man) reminds me of \"Se sei vivo, spara\". Just like Questi's masterpiece, \"El Desperado\" - directed by \"Django\", \"Texas Addio\" and \"Preparati la bara\" screenplay co-writer Rossetti - picks up the subject of everyone's obsessive greed that leads to self-destruction as well as moral decomposition. Even priests and judges can not be trusted in this movie. It's a dirty world, so the long torture/murder scene in the mud is apt. Regarding the tavern brawl scene in the middle of the movie, it is by no means a standard genre scene! Steve requires that fight so he can kill one of his enemies unnoticed, it is a deliberate part of his revenge plan! Also, there are little touches like the piano player beating up somebody who by mistake hit a chord on his instrument. Very well directed, thus it is a pity it remained Rossetti's only western.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com \n\n\"It's too bad Franco Rossetti didn't make more westerns; this is his only oater and it's a pretty good spaghetti western. I liked Chip Corman (Andrea Giordana) as Steve, El Desperado, who spends much of his screen time in a Confederate soldier uniform masquerading as a blind man's returning son. He's not, of course, he's really after a stash of gold the blind man has been saving, hidden in a ghost town that's right out of Django, all mud and muck. Pretty soon though a gang shows up to waylay a Confederate payroll that's rolling through the town. The only negatives are the unavoidable fistfight/barroom brawl and a scene where Desperado gets kicked around in the mud which goes on too long. The finale is great and makes up for quite a bit of the typical spaghetti hi-jinx which leaves non-fans of the genre cold. If you like pasta you'll dig this almost unknown gem. Just released by Wild East, this has a good widescreen transfer and looks great!\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): El desperado\nArgentina: La ley de la violencia\nBrazil (reissue title): Sujos e Sem Lei\nBrazil: O Amargo Sabor da Vingança\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Мръсни бандити\nCanada (French title): El Desperado\nDenmark: Django, ulven fra Texas\nFrance: La boue, le massacre et le mort\nFrance: Le massacre et le sang\nGermany (DVD title): Django - Die im Schlamm verrecken\nGermany (DVD title): Django - die im Staub verrecken\nGreece (transliterated title): Texas desperados\nGreece: Βρώμικοι Παράνομοι\nPortugal: O Desesperado\nSpain: El desesperado\nUK: King of the West\nUSA: Big Ripoff\nUSA: The Dirty Outlaws\nWest Germany: Die im Staub verrecken\nWest Germany: Escondido\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The acting is top-notch as far as Italian Westerns go. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing great, and the direction superb. The sets are great but shrouded in a mysterious fog that lends to the movies surrealism.

        "Title": "Alien Thunder | DONALD SUTHERLAND | Western Movie | Full Length Classic Feature Film | English",
        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Alien Thunder - Western - Based on an actual event, this is the tragic story of Saskatchewan fugitive Almighty Voice (Gordon Tootoosis), a Cree Indian who isarrested for stealing government livestock out of desperate hunger.\n\nAlien Thunder (1974)\nDirector: Claude Fournier\nWriter: George Malko\nStars: Donald Sutherland, Gordon Tootoosis, Chief Dan George\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Canada\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: April 1977 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Kampf im Wilden Westen - Collection 1 \nFilming Locations: Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nStoryline:\nBased on an actual event, this is the tragic story of Saskatchewan fugitive Almighty Voice (Gordon Tootoosis), a Cree Indian who isarrested for stealing government livestock out of desperate hunger.\n\nReviews:\n\"ALIEN THUNDER is based on the true story of Almighty Voice, a Cree Indian fugitive that eluded the Mounties for over a year. Donald Sutherland plays Mounty Dan Candy who is obsessed with \"getting his man\". The film is alternately sympathetic towards the white police officers and the Native Americans. Two of the First Nation stars are Oscar nominated Chief Dan George who plays Sounding Sky and, in his screen debut, Gordon Tootoosis in the title role. It is Donald Sutherland who steals the show with his role as the tall tale telling, comforting, determined N.W.M.P.. The film is recommended not for its plot, which wears a bit thin, but for it's vivid capturing of early Canadian pioneer life and Northern Cree culture.\" Written by ram-30 on IMDb.com \n\n\"Donald Sutherland plays Mountie Dan Candy as if the character he knew he was in a movie and kept pushing it to be an action/adventure film, or a revenge movie, or a revisionist Western with a hero who could make a difference - but he's not. He's in an historical docudrama about a series of related domestic tragedies. Which means that the outcome is predetermined, and after insisting he has some power to effect matters for the better, he is left with the Indians to witness the end unfold.\n\nThis is the clue to the real strength of the film, which many would find its greatest fault. It is indeed slow, in order to accommodate an elegiac visual style. Tone and effect - essentially of sorrow, and of powerlessness over the historic inevitability of it all - form the real substance of the movie.\n\nIt's understandable that such is not to the taste of many audiences. But the film makers do deserve credit for attempting to approach their material in this fashion, rather than opt for something more profitably \"exciting.\" That said, it must be admitted that a large scale production like this is operating on what appears to be a crash budget, and that doesn't help. It certainly didn't help in the preservation of the film, the available print on DVD is pretty bad. But occasionally the cinematography rises to the majesty that the script and director are calling for it, and eerie and beautiful moments pop up in the film, often when you least expect it.\n\nNot really a success, but by no means simply a failure.\" Written by winner55 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) Alien Thunder\nAustralia Dan Candy's Law.\nAustria Ferner Donner\nCanada (French title) Le tonnerre rouge\nDenmark Indian Killer\nFinland Intiaanitappaja\nGermany (DVD box title) Kampf im Wilden Westen - Collection 1\nHungary Candy törvénye\nNorway Indian Killer\nPoland Prawo Dana Candy'ego\nSweden Indian Killer\nSweden (video box title) Alien thunder\nUK (TV title) Dan Candy's Law\nUSA (reissue title) Dan Candy's Law\nWest Germany Ferner Donner\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "The Moment to Kill | SPAGHETTI WESTERN | Wild West | Cowboy Feature Film | Full Length",
        "Description": "Free Western Movie: The Moment to Kill - Italo Western (Italian: Il momento di uccidere) is a 1968 spaghetti western film. This was the first film entirely directed by Giuliano Carnimeo. - Lord and Bull are two adventurers recruited by Judge Warren for a mysterious mission. On reaching the village to know the details of the mission they don't find the judge and discover that many people want them dead.\n\nThe Moment to Kill (1968)\nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo (as Anthony Ascott)\nWriters: Tito Carpi (screenplay), Enzo G. Castellari (idea) \nStars: George Hilton, Walter Barnes, Horst Frank\nGenre: Western, Action\nCountry: Italy | West Germany\nLanguage: Italian\nRelease Date: 28 November 1968 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: The Moment of Killing \nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nStoryline:\n\"To unearth $500,000 in gold hidden by a Confederate colonel after his death, Judge Warren enlists the help of the notorious gunslingers, Lord and Bull. However, this is a delicate and challenging mission, as the pair's only clues lead them to a dusty small town where the colonel's relatives, the mighty Forrester family, have, too, set their sights on finding the gold. Now, Lord and Bull find themselves up against an entire army of cut-throats, bent on getting them out of the way. Will they make it out of this death trap alive and in one piece?\" Written by Nick Riganas on IMDb.com \n\nReviews:\n\"The second Western from Giuliano Carnimeo is a perfect production with a great cast. George Hilton and Walter Barnes are a perfect team and on the other side the great german actor Horst Frank. As Regina Loni von Friedl is also very good and insidious. Responsible for the good looking of the movie is Stelvio Massi with his camerawork. The movie has also a ironic sense of humor which is very good for it. Francesco de Masi did a great job with the wunderfull music. Giuliano Carnimeo and George Hilton made also a few other good movies together f.ex. the Giallo \"Perché quelle strane gocce di sangue sul corpo di Jennifer?\" or the western- comedy \" Il West ti va stretto, amico ... è arrivato Alleluja\". Carnimeo is also responsible for three of the Sartana- movies with Gianni Garko.\" Written by garko80 on IMDb.com \n\n\"The DVD company Wild East put this out with another George Hilton spaghetti western on the same disc, \"Full House For The Devil\". The two compliment each other, and not in a good way. This is a pretty poor western. The first third of the movie is very confusing, with motivations by the various characters murky. Eventually we learn what's going on, but the movie doesn't really improve with that knowledge. The story remains very slow-moving, and the sporadic action sequences are not particularly exciting. The two protagonists (played by Hilton and Walter Barnes) are not very likable, coming across as kind of smug and cold-hearted. Is there anything of merit to be found here? Well, the opening credits song is not bad, and the director occasionally pulls off an interesting visual. But I think even the biggest spaghetti western fans won't find this limited merit enough to make the movie worth investing their time with.\" Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Know As (AKA)\n(original title) Il momento di uccidere\nArgentina (poster title) Gratis no mato\nBrazil Bandoleiros Violentos em Fúria\nBrazil Hora de Matar\nChile El momento de matar\nDenmark De kom for at dræbe\nFinland Kuolema kulkee lännessä\nFrance Le moment de tuer\nGreece Il Momento di Uccidere\nMexico La hora de matar\nPortugal O Momento de Matar\nSpain El momento de matar\nSweden De kom för att döda\nUSA The Moment to Kill\nWest Germany Django - Ein Sarg voll Blut\nThe Moment of Killing\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

One of them is the chasing of Jed by a revenge seeking lawman played by Telly Savalas, and the other is the dysfunctional love story of Sonny and Jed.\n\nFranciscus, the character played by Savalas, seems out of place in a spaghetti western, wearing a long fur coat and basically being Kojak, accent and all. He even talks more like he belongs in a 1970's cop movie than a western. In one part he even calls Jed a \"punk.\" I'm not sure, but I don't think I've ever heard that word in a spaghetti western before this one. I love when spaghetti westerns have these offbeat characters that don't belong in a western. It always makes for a cool and interesting movie. In the middle of the film, after Franciscus becomes disabled, Savalas gets to portray him as a totally different character, as his personality changes and his style of clothing becomes even more bizarre. He is truly great in this role.\n\nTomas Milian plays the part of Jed, a character similar to the one he portrayed in Companeros, but a bit cruder. He is fantastic as usual. He plays this type of character perfectly. His antics are a lot of fun to watch. He even eats spaghetti in this movie! I've always wanted to see that in a spaghetti western. Susan George is good for the role of Sonny. There is one part where she uses 1960's slang when she speaks. You've just gotta love these Italian westerns!\n\nEnnio Morricone's score is brilliant, and one of his more memorable. It is not the typical spaghetti western score, but it fits, and has that haunting Euro-movie style.\n\nDefinitely a must see for Euro-western fans\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) La banda J. & S. - Cronaca criminale del Far West\nAustralia Jed & Sonny\nBrazil Sonny & Jed (O Bando J & S)\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title) Сони и Джед\nCanada (English title) Sonny & Jed\nCanada (French title) Sonny et Jed\nDenmark Vestens skøreste banditter\nFinland Lännen karhukopla\nFrance Far West Story\nFrance (video title) La bande J & S\nGreece (transliterated title) Listeia ala Amerikanika\nItaly La banda J. & S. - Cronaca criminale del Far West\nJapan (English title) J & S: Criminal Story of an Outlaw Couple\nJapan J & S/Sasurai no toubou-sha\nJapan (Japanese title) J&S/さすらいの逃亡者\nNetherlands (video title) The Gang of the 'Fare' West\nSpain Los hijos del día y de la noche\nSweden Grym revansch\nUK (alternative title) Far West Story\nUK (video title) Bandits!\nUSA (video box title) Bandits!\nUSA (video box title) Bandera Bandits\nWest Germany Die rote Sonne der Rache\nWorld-wide (English title) (alternative title) J & S: Criminal Story of an Outlaw Couple\nWorld-wide (English title) Sonny and Jed\nWorld-wide (English title) (closing credits title) J & S\nWorld-wide (English title) (alternative spelling) Sonny & Jed\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Bullets Don't Argue - Spaghetti Western - On his own wedding day, sheriff Pat Garrett must leave and try to arrest two bank robbers. \n\nBullets Don't Argue (1964)\nDirector: Mario Caiano (as Fred Wilson, Manfred Riegert, Mike Perkins)\nWriters: Gianni Castellano (screenplay) (as Franz Wieland, Franz Waller), Giuseppe Moccia (screenplay) (as Daniel Mooch, Donald Mooch) \nStars: Rod Cameron, Ángel Aranda, Horst Frank \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain | West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 October 1964 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Guns Don't Talk \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nOn his own wedding day, sheriff Pat Garrett must leave and try to arrest two bank robbers.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is the film that Jolly Films of Rome and the other producing companies were putting their hopes and money into while tossing a bone to an unknown director named Sergio Leone, giving him film ends and minimal financing to shoot a movie called The Magnificent Stranger which featured a little-known American TV actor named Clint Eastwood. BULLETS DON'T ARGUE starred Rod Cameron, a bigger name, as Pat Garrett, with Horst Frank and Angel Aranda as Billy and George Clanton, thus mixing two old west legends into a very typically American spaghetti western. It kind of reminded me of the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott westerns of the late fifties, with Cameron as the stoic, older authority figure bringing in the wild, younger outlaws, and is pretty darned good, doing what it sets out to do. Oddly enough the highlight of Morricone's score is the song Lonesome Billy, about the elder of the outlaw brothers. BTW I think this is the film that did so poorly at the Italian box office that it prompted Variety to report that spaghetti westerns were dead, a week or so before the Leone/Eastwood film, retitled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, turned the film world on its ear.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\n\"This film is a ripping off of American westerns. When I say ripping off I don't mean it is a poor film. It has the typical western elements: sheriffs and bandits. The role of the characters is well defined and at the end of the story the good will triumph on bad. Many films-loving people didn't understand why this film hadn't had success in Italy. First of all it was played by unknown actors, at least in Italy. Moreover, westerns were getting to be on the wane from 1965. But the main reason is that Italians were bored about classic westerns (\"the stagecoach\", \"Rio Grande\", \"Cimarron\", \"saddle the wind\" etc) they preferred action, shootings and a bit of violence. So the film \"a fistful of dollars\" released a few weeks later was a great success because it started a new era of making westerns as Italians preferred.\n\nThis was one of the first westerns to have false names of director and actors so as to make it seem like an American film. Probably it was shot without recording the audio even if many actors spoke English. It was released in Italian and in English both dubbed. Rod Cameron dubbed himself.\" Written by entomol71 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Le pistole non discutono\nAustria: Die letzten Zwei vom Rio Bravo\nBelgium (French title) (dubbed version): Colt et dollars\nBrazil: As Pistolas não Discutem\nDenmark: De sidste to fra Rio Bravo\nFrance: Mon colt fait la loi\nGreece (transliterated title): Ta pistolia den pairnoun apo logia\nSpain: Las pistolas no discuten\nSweden: 30,000 fördömda dollars\nUSA: Bullets Don't Argue\nUSA: Pistols Don't Argue\nWest Germany: Die letzten Zwei vom Rio Bravo\nWorld-wide (English title) (informal title): Bullets Don't Lie\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Revolveri odlucuju\nGuns Don't Talk\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Blood Money 1974 - Spaghetti Western - A martial artist joins a hard-hitting gunfighter in the search for treasure while bandits step into their way.\n\nBlood Money (1974)\nDirector: Antonio Margheriti (as Anthony M. Dawson)\nWriters: Barth Jules Sussman, Miguel de Echarri (only credited in Spanish version)\nStars: Lee Van Cleef, Lieh Lo, Patty Shepard\nGenre: Comedy, Western\nRuntime: 1h 38min\nCountry: Spain | Italy | Hong Kong | USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 12 February 1975 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Blood Money\nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nDuring a hold-up in the Wild West, Dakota kills a rich old Chinese man, Wang. Later, he is captured, sentenced, and is about to be hanged - but he never profited from Wang's death- only finding the photographs of his four widows and a fortune cookie. Meanwhile, Lo comes to America in search of his uncle's fortune after his family is held hostage. He frees Dakota from the Hangman, since he's the only one who can help find Wang's fortune. Now, the difficult part will really start... the Treasure hunt. First they need to locate the four clues, a tattoo on each of Wang's widow's butts, then uncover the fortune while being hunted by a religious fanatic/ ex-confederate soldier who is on to their game.\n\nReview:\n\"Blood Money\", also known as \"The Stranger and the Gunfighter\", is an interesting combination of gun play and flying fists. Lee VanCleef may not be at the top of his game, but the unusual and entertaining story makes up for any edge he might have lost. I found more humor here than in any of the \"Trinity\" films. If you look at the entertainment value alone, I would say this is about on a par with \"Death Rides a Horse\" or \"Kid Vengeance\". It is definitely inferior to \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\", \"For a Few Dollars More\", and \"The Big Gundown\". Overall, I would recommend \"Blood Money\" as a must see for Lee VanCleef fans. - MERK\" Written by merklekranz on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) El karate el Colt y el impostor\nArgentina Dinero sangriento\nAustralia Blood Money\nAustria In meiner Wut wieg' ich vier Zentner\nBelgium (French title) La brute, le colt et le karaté\nBelgium (Flemish title) De colt, de harde en de karate\nBrazil Dinheiro Sangrento\nBrazil (reissue title) Kung Fu na Trilha do Dinheiro Sangrento\nBrazil (TV title) O Dragão Chinês e o Pistoleiro\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title) Чужденецът и Бързата пушка\nCanada (English title) Blood Money\nCanada (English title) (alternative title) The Stranger and the Gunfighter\nChile Dinero sangriento\nChina (Mandarin title) (transliterated title) Long hu zou tian ya\nDenmark Borte med westen\nDenmark (alternative title) Guld under baelestedet\nDenmark (alternative title) Revolver-manden og den fremmende\nFinland (video title) Revolverimies ja muukalainen\nFinland Eipäs leikitä tulella\nFrance La brute, le colt et le karaté\nFrance (video title) Dakota\nFrance (video title) Le prix du sang\nGreece (transliterated title) To kynigi tou kitrinou thisavrou\nGreece (video title) O xenos kai o oploforos\nGreece (alternative title) Ο ξένος και ο οπλοφόρος\nGreece (alternative title) Το κυνήγι του κίτρινου θησαυρού\nGreece Ματωμένα Χρήματα\nHong Kong (Mandarin title) Long hu zou tian ya\nIreland (English title) Blood Money\nItaly Là dove non batte il sole\nMexico Dinero sangriento\nMexico (alternative title) El karateca y el pistolero\nNew Zealand (English title) Blood Money\nNorway Blodpenger\nNorway (video title) Revolvermannen og den fremmede\nNorway (alternative title) Blood Money\nPoland Krwawe pieniądze\nPortugal Onde o Sol Nunca Brilha\nRomania Bani însângeraţi\nSoviet Union (Russian title) Кровные деньги\nSoviet Union (Russian title) (transliterated title) Krovnyye den'gi\nSpain (working title) Moneda sangrienta\nSweden Revolvermannen och främlingen\nThailand (English title) Blood Money\nUK Blood Money\nUSA (DVD title) Blood Money\nUSA (dubbed version) The Stranger and the Gunfighter\nVenezuela Dinero sangriento\nWest Germany In meiner Wut wieg' ich vier Zentner\nWest Germany Kung Fu im wilden Westen\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

The sheriff asks the army for help, which orders Captain Mike Jackson to see what is going on in his old home town and also search for a government agent who has disappeared in that area. Jackson immediately finds himself in the middle of fist fights and shoot-outs with the bandits.\n\nReviews:\n\"When Jeff Cameron is at the top of your cast list, you know you’re about to embark on a low-budget ride through Spaghetti land.\n\nAnd this one doesn’t disappoint in that sense, with banal dialogue (check out the last quote below), lots of horse riding scenes and lots of bad guys doing acrobatic death spirals after our hero points his gun in their general direction.\n\nThis one does benefit from a larger cast than most, which makes for a slightly more complicated plot.\n\nJust don’t spend too long thinking about some of the plot twists, like why Mary’s father would reveal the secret location of his mine to a government agent minutes after meeting the man\n\nThe story line also includes a truly imaginative way to do away with the film’s bad girl (Esmeralda Barros as Paquita) so that Jeff doesn’t have to be responsible for gunning down a female.\n\nThat slightly larger than normal cast includes Donal O’Brien as a sneering villain with a penchant for pretty girls, and Krista Nell as Jeff’s former lover, forced into a life of whoredom by the low-lifes who have taken over Landford City.\" Written by Mark Franklin on onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): La colt era il suo Dio\nBrazil: O Colt Era o Seu Deus\nFinland (video box title): Kuudestilaukeavan laki\nFrance: Le colt était son dieu\nGermany: Nur Gott war sein Colt\nUSA: God Is My Colt .45\nWorld-wide (English title) (complete title): God Is My Colt\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Italian Crime Western set in Texas in 1870 starring Guy Madison: Long Days of Hate - Spaghetti Western - A bounty, Benson is hunting down a vicious outlaw gang, who killed his parents, brother and sisters, except for one sister, Susy, who he wants for himself! \n\nLong Days of Hate (1968)\nDirector: Gianfranco Baldanello\nWriters: Luigi Emmanuele (story), Luigi Emmanuele (screenplay) \nStars: Guy Madison, Lucienne Bridou, Rik Battaglia \nGenres: Crime | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 20 July 1973 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: This Man Can't Die \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nIn 1870 Texas, a gang of gun smugglers supplies arms, ammunition and whiskey to Indians. Undercover government agent Martin Benson helps the army eliminate such smugglers. However, the army still needs to know the identity of the man in charge of the gang and the location of their latest hideout. Martin Benson wants to retire but the army asks him to find the head of the smugglers. The army arguments that Benson is the best agent for the job even if another undercover agent, Tony Guy, has already penetrated the smugglers' outfit. A huge payment in gold coins is also offered to Benson as an enticement. Benson agrees to this last assignment and heads out of the army fort. On the trail, many gun runners and bandits try to ambush him and have him killed. In the nearest town, at the Benson farm, a group of smugglers raid and ransack the farm and kill Martin Benson's parents. They also rape his sister, Jenny. The other Benson siblings, Arias, Susy and Daniel are in town buying supplies. \n\nReviews:\n\"\"I lunghi giorni dell'odio\" (litrall translation: \"Long Days of Hate\") AKA \"This Man Can't Die\" (1967), directed by the capable Gianfranco Baldanello, who would go on to make the infamous \"Black Jack\" (1968), is above average Spaghetti Western. While not on the same level as Leone, Corbucci or Castellari, this film still holds it's grip pretty well, with excellent action scenes, some well staged bar brawls, very well done shootouts and a neat, Leonesque showdown for the climax. The plot is the usual story: parents murdered and daughter raped by outlaws, the sons set out to avenge their deaths. But it's capably handled, even if the revealing of who the head of the outlaws is is no big surprise. Still, a must-see for fans of the Spaghetti Western genre.\" Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com\n\n\"Released in 1968 and directed by Gianfranco Baldanello, \"This Man Can't Die\" (aka \"The Long Days of Hate\") stars Guy Madison as a government-hired agent looking for the ringleader of a group of gunrunner/bootleggers. Meanwhile his parents are murdered and youngest sister raped (Anna Liotti). Will he and his younger brother & other sister (Steve Merrick & Susy Benson) find the killers and their ringleader? Rik Battaglia and Rosalba Neri are also on hand.\n\nThis is a serious spaghetti Western more akin to Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) than his comic booky (and sometimes goofy) Man with No Name trilogy. But it's half as long as \"Once Upon a Time\" and therefore leaner, which is better in my book (although \"Once Upon a Time\" is technically the better movie). While not great, it's a solid Western with a lousy English-speaking title. Too bad Anna Liotti's role wasn't bigger because she's an ultra-cutie.\" Written by Wuchakk on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): I lunghi giorni dell'odio\nArgentina: Este hombre no puede morir\nBelgium (French title): Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nBelgium (Flemish title): Deze man mag niet sterven\nBrazil: Este Homem Não Deve Morrer\nCanada (English title): This Man Can't Die\nDenmark: Den mand må ikke dø\nFinland: Tämä mies ei kuole\nFrance: Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nGreece (transliterated title): Kremaste ta katharmata\nGreece (video title): Agria ekdikisi\nNorway: This Man Can't Die\nPortugal: O Longo Dia do Ódio\nRomania: Acest om nu trebuie să moară\nSweden: Uppgörelsen\nUSA: Long Days of Hate\nWest Germany: Seine Winchester pfeift das Lied vom Tod\n This Man Can't Die\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Kill the Poker Player - Federal agent Alan Fields, undercover as Jonathan Pinkerton, an employee of Lloyds of London, is investigating a bank robbery where one of the three thieves has killed the other two to take possession of all the money. \n\nKill the Poker Player (1972)\nDirector: Mario Bianchi (as Frank Bronston)\nWriters: Mario Bianchi (screenplay), Mario Bianchi (story) \nStars: Robert Woods, Frank Braña, Nieves Navarro \nGenres: Mystery | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 9 April 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Creeping Death \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nTwo men pull off a bank heist, making sure to leave no witnesses behind.\n\nBut when they meet up with a third partner to split the loot, they wind up staked out and bitten to death by poisonous snakes.\n\nFlash forward two years and Lloyd’s of London agent Jonathan Pinkerton (Robert Woods) shows up in Red Stone, determined to find that third partner, convinced a bank employee was involved.\n\nAnd he makes it known around town that a $200,000 reward awaits the individual who helps him crack the case. That, naturally, attracts lots of interest.\n\nPinkerton also winds up with a growing list of suspects, including a sheriff (Frank Brana) who never seems to be around when he’s needed, a rancher on the brink of financial ruin (Ivano Staccioli), a hotel owner with a questionable past (Carlo Gaddi) and a doctor (Ernesto Colli) with a strange fascination for snakes.\n\nThen, just when Pinkerton — known as Mr. London around town — starts to unravel the mystery, dead bodies start showing up.\n\nAnd he winds up in jail, accused of being responsible for some of those deaths.\n\nReviews:\n\"The opening will draw you in. A cowboy walks into a saloon, exchanges glances with a cavalry officer, then walks back out and head to the bank. He robs it, shooting everyone inside. So no one can interfere, the man dressed like a cavalry officer kills everyone in the bar. And when the bank manager emerges wounded, but preparing to fire a shot at the fleeing bandit, he’s gunned down from a second-story window.\n\nSoon, the cowboy and the cavalry officer are dead, and that mysterious man from the second-story window is riding off with the loot. And nine minutes into the film, not a word has been spoken.\n\nAfter that, it plays out like a mystery as much as a Western, with Woods getting himself out of just as many jams with his quick thinking and his fists as with his guns.\n\nOh, and Nieves Navarro is up to her old gold-digging tricks again. The Italian beauty is married to the saloon owner, but having an affair with the rancher and seemingly quite intrigued by the reward Pinkerton is offering.\" Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\n\"Now, here is a genuine Western Giallo! During a bank robbery, three robbers get away with quite a lot of cash but slaughter a vast amount of people to get it. We see the faces of two of these guys, but third is kept a secret, and shortly after the other two are killed by extremely fake looking snakes, we find out why - the murderer has assumed a different identity and is hiding out in a frontier town, and it's up to George Hilton lookalike Robert Woods to find them.\n\nRobert is playing a man called Jonathan Pinkerton, send for Lloyds Bank London to find the missing money. He is immediately given the name Mr London as he goes around the town trying to figure out what's going on...a town which seems to be suffering from a plague of snakes. Suspects include a snake studying doctor who claims the snakes tell him things, sheriff Frank Bana who is equally suspicious of Pinkerton, shifty ranch owner Clinton, the guys who owns the bar and his sneaky girlfriend Susan Scott.\" Written by Bezenby on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Hai sbagliato... dovevi uccidermi subito!\nBrazil: Ringo...

        "Description": "Italian Cowboy Classic from 1968 also known as Uno di più all'inferno starring George Hilton: To Hell and Back - Spaghetti Western - Johnny King, a rebellious drifter, sets out to avenge the death of his mentor and friend, Steve, after he has been murdered for his land by the Ward Brothers.\n\nTo Hell and Back (1968)\nDirector: Giovanni Fago\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi (screenplay), Ernesto Gastaldi (story)\nStars: George Hilton, Paolo Gozlino, Claudie Lange \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 April 1969 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Cehenneme bir kişi daha \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nJohnny King, a rebellious drifter, sets out to avenge the death of his mentor and friend, Steve, after he has been murdered for his land by the Ward Brothers. After causing some trouble for the Wards, Johnny faces a new opponent, his outlaw friend, Meredith.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is a very entertaining SW from Giovanni Fago and the prolific western and horror screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. Fago had collaborated with Gastaldi before on Vengeance Is Mine (1967) and the next year would direct the Tomas Milian vehicle O Cagnaciero!, which points back to the influence on the SW of the Brazilian film Black God White Devil (1964).\n\nA buddy film, the light slapstick of the first half of the film plays well as the rather effeminate gunfighter Johnny King (George Hilton) runs through a number of dangerous situations with a sarcastic grin, fighting off land speculators, sleeping with the sheriff's flame, participating in a barroom fight in drag, in a knock-down drag-out fight in a jail cell, escaping from jail and then concocting an absurd but successful plan to rob a bank. During all this he meets Meredith (played by Paolo Gozlino), a rough but incompetent bandit who meets with surprising success when matched with the clever King.\n\nThe comedy darkens, though, when King returns to town after the bank heist to find his former guardian Pastor Steve killed by the land speculators. Then ensues the plot for revenge, which involves absurd methods of murder and torture and a final gunfight reminiscent of the finale to Taste For Killing. King gives up ruffles for black (he had trained in seminary, he claimed at one point) and begins quoting passages from the Bible.\n\nGerard Hertar is his usual sinister best as the sharp shooting Ernest Ward. He would play a similar role in the riotous Adios Sabata (1970). In the world of the SW, wealthy landowners indulge in the Sadean pleasures of target practice at live targets, almost always human. Besides Adios Sabata and Full House For The Devil, you find similar scenes in Django and The Fighting Fist Of Shanghai Joe.\n\nThe film follows the usual SW plot of an arrogant character that takes on more than he can handle, is humbled (beaten, shot, burnt, hung, crucified) before he either changes certain elements of his character or learns the secret (the iron plate in Fistful Of Dollars) necessary to ultimately succeed. Ernesto Gastaldi isolated this basic storyline in most of his westerns and used to again in this film.\" Written by rmahaney4 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): Uno di più all'inferno\nBrazil: Mais um para o Inferno\nFrance: Los machos\nGreece (video title): Enas akoma gia tin Kolasi\nGreece (transliterated title): Fotia apo dodeka pistolia\nItaly: Uno di più all'inferno\nPortugal: Mais Um para o Inferno\nSpain: Uno más al infierno\nTurkey (Turkish title): Cehenneme bir kişi daha\nUSA: To Hell and Back\nUSA: One More to Hell\nUSA (poster title): Full House for the Devil\nWest Germany: Django - Melodie in Blei\n\n····················································································\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\n····················································································\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Written by Woodyanders\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"George (likable John Fordyce) and John McIntire (the equally engaging Chris Chittell) are a couple of naive brothers who travel to a lawless western town to see their father. The bumbling siblings find themselves in big trouble after they beat up a member of a gang of extortionists. Fortunately, shrewd and lethal mysterious gunfighter Camposanto (the great Gianno Garko, as smooth and charismatic as ever) decides to help the guys out of their jam by teaching them how to fend for themselves. Director Giuliano Carnimeo, working from a blithely silly and playful script by Enzo Barboni, relates the breezy story at a constant brisk pace, maintains a properly lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the wacky slapstick brawls and energetic shoot-outs with real verve (the climactic thrilling and dynamic confrontation between our heroes and the bad guys in particular seriously smokes). William Berger delivers a terrifically assured and commanding performance as crafty and deadly rival gunslinger Duke; the easy and natural chemistry between Berger and Garko makes all their scenes together a total pleasure to watch. Bruno Nicolai's rousing, twangy, and spirited score hits the stirring spot. Stelvio Massi's lively widescreen cinematography boasts a lots of crazy zooms and fierce pans. An immensely enjoyable and often amusing comedic romp.\" Written by Woodyanders on IMDb.com\n\n\"This one's a keeper! Mega-stylish fun from Guiliano Carnimeo, who would also give us The Case of the Bloody Iris, one of the best gialli around. This time he's got two (camp) brothers heading from the East back to their dad's ranch, who's having trouble with an extortion racket. The brothers are absolutely crap at everything, so luckily for them dark stranger Ace (Gianni Garko) comes to their aid. Unluckily for them, the bad guys have hired William Berger to kill them.\n\nGarko shows the two fops how to mete out justice in the Wild West, while Berger sits around moodily waiting to pop a cap in their behinds. He's got this little collapsible whiskey cup, that, when folded up and put away, is a signal that someone nearby is going to shortly resemble a colander. Berger and Garko have a mutual respect for each other which is played rather nicely through the film. \n\nThere's plenty of gunfights here, a bit of slapstick, and your usual big fight at the end. If you can get over some of the broad comedy (a trend in these flicks) you'll have a good time here.\" Written by Bezenby\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Gli fumavano le Colt... lo chiamavano Camposanto\nBrazil: Eu Sou Sartana\nDenmark: Skyd først - Spørg bagefter\nFrance (TV title): Quand les colts fument... on l'appelle Cimetière\nGreece (transliterated title): Enas paranomos pou ton legane Nekrothafti\nPortugal: O Forasteiro Invencível\nSpain: Y dejaron de llamarle Camposanto\nSpain (video box title): Funeral por un colt\nSweden: En kula för en främling\nTurkey (Turkish title): Silahların Gölgesinde\nUSA: They Call Him Cemetery\nUSA: His Pistols Smoked...

        "Title": "More Dollars for the MacGregors | WESTERN MOVIE | Gunslinger | Cowboy | Full Length",
        "Description": "Spaghetti Western Drama starring the German Star Peter Lee Lawrance: More Dollars for the MacGregors - Spaghetti Western - Forsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger\n\nMore Dollars for the MacGregors (1970)\nDirector: José Luis Merino\nWriters: Arrigo Colombo, Enrico Colombo \nStars: Peter Lee Lawrence, Carlos Quiney, Malisa Longo \nGenres: Drama | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 September 1970 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Death Seeks a Man \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nForsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger. When the game backfires, and she is killed, he sets out in pursuit, but a mysterious rider joins the chase. \n\nReviews:\n\"George Forsyte (Carlos Quiney) is a notorious bounty killer who is doing his best to earn a grand total of half a million dollars before retiring.  He specialises in setting traps for his victims, drawing them in by using his wife Gladys (María Mahor) as bait, pretending that she’s an innocent on the road carrying plenty of easily purloinable cash; and when he catches them, he shows no mercy, killing them with his trademark technique of a bullet in the forehead.  Things go badly wrong, however, when he tries to bring in vicious killer Joe Saxon (Vidal Molina).  Distracted momentarily by a poisonous snake, he allows Saxon to escape and Gladys is murdered as a result.  Naturally enough, he wants to have revenge, but this doesn’t work out either: before he can get to him Saxon is killed – and the reward on his head is collected – by another bounty hunter called Robert MacGregor (Peter Lee Lawrence).\n\nWhile Forsyte spends time licking his wounds, MacGregor sets off to capture another villain, Ross Steward (Stan Cooper).  Steward and his men are hiding out in the hills, where they’re forcing the local Indians to mine salt, but MacGregor’s initial efforts to locate him result in him being badly beaten and left for dead.  Nursed back to health by tasty squaw Yuma (Malisa Longo), he finds his work has become further complicated by the reappearance of Forsyte, whose motivations have become even less clear following his wife’s death.\n\nIn fact, for the first forty minutes or so it all works very well, but then it shifts focus with the death of Joe Saxon at about the forty minute mark.  At this point Forsyte fades rather into the background – until the final stages of the film at least – and the less defined Macgregor, who had hardly featured previously, takes centre stage.  Several new characters are also introduced, including the erratic Steward and the Indians (who look like nothing so much as escapees from a hippie festival), which acts to defuse the mood and ambience which had developed so nicely. In effect it plays like two parts of a TV series joined together into a feature length production, which raises the question as to whether this was intentional or whether one of the stars was perhaps unavailable for some of the filming and the script had to be adapted at the last moment.

        "Title": "High Lonesome | John Drew Barrymore | American Western | Cowboy Movie | Wild West | English",
        "Description": "American Western Classic starring John Drew Barrymore on 1950: High Lonesome - When a sudden spurt of murders occurs in Texas Big Bend country, suspicion immediately falls on a young drifter who just moved to the area.\n\nHigh Lonesome (1950)\nDirector: Alan Le May\nWriter: Alan Le May\nStars: John Drew Barrymore, Chill Wills, John Archer\nGenre: Western \nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 1 September 1950 (USA) \nAlso Known As: Der Tiger von Texas \nFilming Locations: Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA\n\nStoryline:\nIn Texas' Big Bend country, a young drifter is caught stealing food at the Davis ranch. The Davis clan and the hired hands are immediately suspicious of the young runaway. They nickname him Cooncat. They all suspect Cooncat of running from the law for some crime he committed but he claims to have only run-away from an abusive father who beat him. Nevertheless, the ranch hired hands rough him up until he admits he has committed a murder. Cooncat reveals he killed Jim Shell, the owner of a trading post because the man stole Cooncat's money. He claims that two drifters hiding in the nearby ruins of a house egged him on and even gave him a revolver to commit the murder. However, his recollection is hazy since he was hit over the head by the trading post owner right when he was about to shoot him. No one at the Davis ranch believes his story, except Meagan Davis, the daughter of the Davis patriarch. \n[...]\n After the boy describes the drifters, whom he calls Smiling Man and Roper, his hosts are shocked. The description fits that of two Jessup family members who were killed 15 years before, during a range and fence war with the Davis clan. Cooncat's captors wonder whether the boy is lying or is crazy. Rancher Pat Farrell, engaged to Abby Davis, Meagan's sister, wants to deliver the boy to the sheriff but the Davis family offers to lodge him at their ranch until his story can be checked out in more detail. During the following days, Cooncat escapes his hosts several times but he is re-captured. He claims that all their lives are in danger because he keeps sighting the two drifters, Smiling Man and Roper, snooping around the Davis' ranch. No one believes his strange claims, except for Meagan, of course, who took a liking to him. Next, rancher Pat Farrell' parents are found murdered and circumstances point to Cooncat. Farrell wants to lynch Cooncat but old man Davis saves him, arguing that more evidence is needed. A temporary rift between Farrell and Davis is thus born. Later, when Boatwhistle, the ramrod of the Davis ranch and direct custodian of Cooncat, is found shot to death, they all assume Cooncat to be responsible. Cooncat is missing and so is the revolver that was kept in the old man Davis' office desk drawer. Old man Davis suspects that a bent-on-revenge Cooncat actually is the youngest son of the rival Jessup clan, eliminated 15 years before. A manhunt for Cooncat ensues, but he secretly returns to the ranch to convince Meagan of his innocence. His aim is to find Smiling Man and Roper who are the real killers. With the Davis and the Farrell crews after him, Cooncat races against time to find the real killers before he is caught and lynched.\n\nReviews:\n\"There were so many westerns made, that it has to have a unique angle or something memorable, to sick its head above the parapet. Did I enjoy this movie? Without a doubt. The characters were strong and likable and I really found myself rooting for the young lad. Location? Excellent. The great expanse of the country was well portrayed and the shacks, houses and barns were all spot on. Acting? Good overall. All utterly believable and gave a strong sense of family unit. Storyline? Well this is maybe where the movie didn't quite do itself justice. The story was okay, but has, with variations, been told hundreds of times and it didn't bring much new to the table. But at 80 minutes, it wasn't too long and I found myself glad to have watched and enjoyed it.\" Written by greenheart on IMDb.com \n\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "A Place Called Glory | Lex Barker | WESTERN MOVIE | Wild West | Classic European Feature Film",
        "Description": "European Western Romance from 1965 starring Lex Barker: A Place Called Glory - Former rancher Clint Brenner and the younger Reese, his equal in skill at gun-fighting, are independently recruited to help farmer Seth Grande free the locals of Manitoba town Glory City from vast ranch owner Jack Villaine's rule of terror.\n\nA Place Called Glory (1965)\nDirector: Sheldon Reynolds\nWriters: Edward Di Lorenzo, F.X. Toole  \nStars: Lex Barker, Pierre Brice, Marianne Koch\nGenre: Romance, Western \nCountry: West Germany, Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 July 1965 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Glory City \nFilming Locations: Estudios Balcázar, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nFormer rancher Clint Brenner and the younger Reese, his equal in skill at gun-fighting, are independently recruited to help farmer Seth Grande free the locals of Manitoba town Glory City from vast ranch owner Jack Villaine's rule of terror. They become friends on the job but ignore they'll be pitted as adversaries in the town's founder's day spectacular duel by last-minute blind substitution.\n\nReviews:\n\"The thing that intrigued me about this movie was the character of Clint Brenner and Lex Barker's portrayal of him. Of course there are the usual Western clichés like a range war, the loner coming to town, one man facing a whole gang of hired guns or even the gunslinger fight at the end. Though this one has a nice twist, in that it is an annual prize fight leaving one contestant dead held by the obviously sensationalist, voyeuristic and bloodthirsty population of the town of Glory.\n\nBack to Clint Brenner, one of the gunslingers: He is the essential loner who in a rather funny dialogue verbatim expresses that he chooses not to get involved with other people. Nevertheless he is no sociopath, he has got humour and he gets along with people, he even helps them if it cannot be avoided. What might be a deficit, the fact that it is never explained how and why he got to dislike human company, (there are some hints though) is rather an advantage because the focus is now on how opens up again. In the end there is one, maybe two or three relationships he has got. Two scenes are really outstanding in this context. The first is when the wounded Jade tries to ask him to abandon the fight and Lex Barker's facial expression, especially his eyes, grows suddenly very hard and unforgiving when only the moment before he was very soft. His whole demeanor is saying that he won't discuss this with anybody. The second scene is him lying on the bed just before the fight staring at the ceiling and giving the impression that he is pretty well aware of the fact, that this whole business will boil down on either him killing somebody or him being killed, with every implication this might hold. I also love how this is contrasted with Reese', his opponents, preparations. He is almost carelessly easy and light-hearted about it.\" Written by Equinox23 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As:\n(original title) Die Hölle von Manitoba\nAustria Die weiße Hölle von Manitoba\nBrazil Duelo em Glory City\nCanada (French title) Duel à Glory City\nFinland Manitoban helvetti\nFrance L'enfer du Manitoba\nGreece (transliterated title) Enas apo tous dyo mas tha pethani...\nIreland (English title) A Place Called Glory\nItaly Sfida a Glory City\nPortugal Um Lugar Chamado Pólvora\nSpain Un lugar llamado Glory\nUSA Place Called Glory City\nUSA A Place Called Glory\nWest Germany (working title) Die Unbesiegbaren\nGlory City\nUn lugar llamado 'Glory'\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #grjngo #freewestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "Sonny and Jed | Ranch Western Movie | Cowboys | Classic Western",
        "Description": "Classic Cowboy Film: Sonny and Jed - Spaghetti Western - A determined sheriff pursues a robber and his girlfriend, and lets nothing stop in his way of catching them.\n\nSonny and Jed (1972) \nDirector: Sergio Corbucci\nWriters: Sergio Corbucci (story), Sergio Corbucci (screenplay) \nStars: Tomas Milian, Susan George, Telly Savalas\nGenre: Western | Action | Adventure | Crime\nCountry: Italy | West Germany | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 24 November 1972 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Bandits! \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nA determined sheriff pursues a robber and his girlfriend, and lets nothing stop in his way of catching them.\n\nReviews:\n\"Sergio Leone, the king of spaghetti westerns, would never have dreamed of making a western like \"Sonny and Jed.\" It is a poignant film that was considered daring at the time of its release and is now labeled by many as a cult classic. Tomas Milian, who took the stage name \"Tomas\" after his prime role model: Tomas F. Dobb, plays Jed in an unforgettable role initially intended for Rodney Dangerfield. Susan George plays Sonny, Jed's one-true love and partner-in-crime. This is a \"Bonnie and Clyde\" of the west. It isn't a great film, but it seems to entertain most of the time. The best performance in the film, by far, is by Telly Savalas. He plays a blind sheriff who is determined to catch Sonny and Jed dead or alive by using any means necessary BY HIMSELF! Savalas steals every scene he is in and rightfully so. The final line in the film, \"Sonny, I love you, you M**********r!\", is right up there with the final line in \"Gone with the Wind\". Some believe it's more touching than the \"Gone with the Wind\" line. This is one of those hard to find films like \"A Town Called Hell\", \"Blood and Guns\", and \"Villa Rides.\" Get it if you can.\" Written by MovieMan-112\n\n\"This movie is definitely not your average spaghetti western, and it's uniqueness is part of what makes it great.\n\nThere are really two separate stories being told in the film, and they are both given equal weight. One of them is the chasing of Jed by a revenge seeking lawman played by Telly Savalas, and the other is the dysfunctional love story of Sonny and Jed.\n\nFranciscus, the character played by Savalas, seems out of place in a spaghetti western, wearing a long fur coat and basically being Kojak, accent and all. He even talks more like he belongs in a 1970's cop movie than a western. In one part he even calls Jed a \"punk.\" I'm not sure, but I don't think I've ever heard that word in a spaghetti western before this one. I love when spaghetti westerns have these offbeat characters that don't belong in a western. It always makes for a cool and interesting movie. In the middle of the film, after Franciscus becomes disabled, Savalas gets to portray him as a totally different character, as his personality changes and his style of clothing becomes even more bizarre. He is truly great in this role.\n\nEnnio Morricone's score is brilliant, and one of his more memorable. It is not the typical spaghetti western score, but it fits, and has that haunting Euro-movie style.\n\nDefinitely a must see for Euro-western fans\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) La banda J. & S. - Cronaca criminale del Far West\nAustralia Jed & Sonny\nBrazil Sonny & Jed (O Bando J & S)\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title) Сони и Джед\nCanada (English title) Sonny & Jed\nCanada (French title) Sonny et Jed\nDenmark Vestens skøreste banditter\nFinland Lännen karhukopla\nFrance Far West Story\nFrance (video title) La bande J & S\nGreece (transliterated title) Listeia ala Amerikanika\nItaly La banda J. & S. - Cronaca criminale del Far West\nJapan (English title) J & S: Criminal Story of an Outlaw Couple\nJapan J & S/Sasurai no toubou-sha\nJapan (Japanese title) J&S/さすらいの逃亡者\nNetherlands (video title) The Gang of the 'Fare' West\nSpain Los hijos del día y de la noche\nSweden Grym revansch\nUK (alternative title) Far West Story\nUK (video title) Bandits!\nUSA (video box title) Bandits!\nUSA (video box title) Bandera Bandits\nWest Germany Die rote Sonne der Rache\n\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Caught up in Suttonville's affairs, Blade not only has Voller and the outlaws to deal with, he also goes to settle a score with McGowan (who was responsible for the death of Blade's father) and takes on Voller and his gang who are out to gun him down.\" Written by Daniel Williamson on IMDb.com \n\nReviews:\n\"I absolutely love this film.\n\nThe lead actor, Maurizio Merli, is a handsome man and a decent actor cast in the role of the \"Good\" Bounty Hunter, with Donald O'Brien as the \"Ugly\" thief/wanted man, and John Steiner as the \"Bad\" villain. The acting is top-notch as far as Italian Westerns go. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing great, and the direction superb. The sets are great but shrouded in a mysterious fog that lends to the movies surrealism. This film is like a very Artistic Western Graphic-Novel!\n\nIf you are a fan of movies that are as much art as film, then you should love Italian cinema!\" Written by charley-54 on IMDb.com \n\n\"In the early 70s, Spaghetti Westerns were going through a dry spell. Countless crappy parody films had flooded the market and strangled the life out of the genre. Then Italian crime maestro and occasional Spaghetti director Enzo G. Castellari came along and directed the psychedelic, action-packed masterpiece \"Keoma\". Gone was the cynicism and nihilism that seperated early Spaghettis from American Westerns. Instead there was an injection of emotion. The silent hero of the past was now a heartfelt warrior who wasn't above crying in between bouts of ass-kicking. Needless to say, it revived the genre briefly and led to a few knock-offs. \"Mannaja\" is probably the most obvious with it's similar visual style and music score, but Sergio Martino's keen visual sense (though not as good as Castellari's) and Maurizio Merli's excellent performance allow the film to stand on it's own two legs. There's a lot of well-staged slow motion shootouts and a fistfight in the mud here and there, along with an interesting if not compelling plotline. All in all, this is a great knock-off that has just enough originality to be a good stand-alone piece.

        "Title": "Death Is Sweet from the Soldier of God | Brad Harris | Spaghetti Western | Cowboy Film",
        "Description": "Spaghetti Western in Full Length: Death Is Sweet from the Soldier of God - A former sheriff, after being accused of a robbery and escaping from jail with a revolutionary bandit, seeks revenge for his brother and his family.\n\nDeath Is Sweet from the Soldier of God (1972)\nDirector: Roberto Mauri (as Robert Johnson)\nWriters: Roberto Mauri (story), Roberto Bianchi Montero (story) (as Roberto Montero) \nStars: Brad Harris, José Torres, Maretta Procaccini \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 2 April 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Er säte den Tod \nFilming Locations: Incir De Paolis Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline: \nA former sheriff, after being accused of a robbery and escaping from jail with a revolutionary bandit, seeks revenge for his brother and his family.\n\nReviews:\n\"Brad Harris had signed a contract for three westerns with a production company called Three Stars, but only two of the three movies were completed, Wanted Sabata and Arriva Durango, Paga o Muori. This third part (See Database Page) was produced by another company, and is said to be an assembly of re-edited scenes of the first two movies, with a couple of new scenes added (*1). The film is best know for a couple of great titles (in Italian and English) plus a wonderful poster design, also used for various releases of the movie on VHS and DVD. Biggest throwback: the scene depicted on the poster, is not in the movie.\n\nHarris is Durango (Django in some versions) and he’s a former sheriff falsely accused of a robbery. He ends up in jail with a guy called Spirito Santo, who was arrested for steeling money he needed for the revolution and his poor family at home in Mexico - at least that’s what he says (he also pretends to be one-eyed). The two are sprung out of jail by a mystery man and subsequently join a gang of Mexicans who are looking for the stolen strongbox: Durango to prove his innocence, Santo to collect money for the revolution. We also get a vengeance tale, with Durango looking for the man who killed his brother and his wife.\n\nAs one might expect from an assembly movie, Death is Sweet ... doesn’t hang together. The vengeance tale is particularly stupid: Durango tracks down the killer and takes his revenge, but an earlier scene clearly showed that this man - played by Vassili Karis - was not responsible for the slayings; when he arrived on the spot, Durango’s relatives were already dead and he has been trying to eliminate Durango ever since, because he - Durango - would never believe that he was innocent. What nonsense! Is the movie worth tracking down? Harris is his usual self, steady as a rock and acting like one, but the patchwork seems to hurt Torres' performance: In Arriva Durango ... his hyperactive style worked well in combination with Harris' stoicism, but here his character has no consistency and his overzealous routines - invoking la madre de Dios every other minute or so - quickly become annoying. For completists only. But that poster is a killer.\" Written by Simon Gelten on spaghetti-western.net.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Seminò morte... lo chiamavano il Castigo di Dio!\nGermany: Er säte den Tod\nGreece (transliterated title): Ton fonazan Pistola\nItaly: Seminò morte... lo chiamavano il Castigo di Dio!\nUSA: Death Is Sweet from the Soldier of God\nUSA: Django...

        "Title": "The Dirty Outlaws | Old Cowboy Movie | Spaghetti Western",
        "Description": "Full Western Movie: The Dirty Outlaws - Spaghetti Western - An outlaw masquerades as the son of a blind man in order to find a cache of gold located in a vacated town.\n\nThe Dirty Outlaws (1967)\nDirector: Franco Rossetti\nWriters: Vincenzo Cerami, Ugo Guerra \nStars: Andrea Giordana, Rosemary Dexter, Franco Giornelli\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 January 1969 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Django - Die im Schlamm verrecken \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nThe film tells the story of an outlaw who masquerades as a blind man's son in order to trick the old man out of a cache of gold located in a vacated town. A gang of bandits appears in the same town to rob a payroll coach that has to pass through and they take the blind man's gold as well, setting the desperado against the gang.\n\nReviews:\n\"A man known as \"Desperaaadooo\" to his enemies and the singer of the title song, or simply Steve (Andrea Giordana, \"Quella sporca storia nel west\") to his friends, tries to make money outside the law at the end of the civil war. He stops at nothing, even stealing it from a blind man seems not to trouble him. Nevertheless, when that old man is killed, Desperado decides to avenge his death. Not only the presence of Piero Lulli (plays the blind man) reminds me of \"Se sei vivo, spara\". Just like Questi's masterpiece, \"El Desperado\" - directed by \"Django\", \"Texas Addio\" and \"Preparati la bara\" screenplay co-writer Rossetti - picks up the subject of everyone's obsessive greed that leads to self-destruction as well as moral decomposition. Even priests and judges can not be trusted in this movie. It's a dirty world, so the long torture/murder scene in the mud is apt. Regarding the tavern brawl scene in the middle of the movie, it is by no means a standard genre scene! Steve requires that fight so he can kill one of his enemies unnoticed, it is a deliberate part of his revenge plan! Also, there are little touches like the piano player beating up somebody who by mistake hit a chord on his instrument. Very well directed, thus it is a pity it remained Rossetti's only western.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com \n\n\"It's too bad Franco Rossetti didn't make more westerns; this is his only oater and it's a pretty good spaghetti western. I liked Chip Corman (Andrea Giordana) as Steve, El Desperado, who spends much of his screen time in a Confederate soldier uniform masquerading as a blind man's returning son. He's not, of course, he's really after a stash of gold the blind man has been saving, hidden in a ghost town that's right out of Django, all mud and muck. Pretty soon though a gang shows up to waylay a Confederate payroll that's rolling through the town. The only negatives are the unavoidable fistfight/barroom brawl and a scene where Desperado gets kicked around in the mud which goes on too long. The finale is great and makes up for quite a bit of the typical spaghetti hi-jinx which leaves non-fans of the genre cold. If you like pasta you'll dig this almost unknown gem. Just released by Wild East, this has a good widescreen transfer and looks great!\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): El desperado\nArgentina: La ley de la violencia\nBrazil (reissue title): Sujos e Sem Lei\nBrazil: O Amargo Sabor da Vingança\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Мръсни бандити\nCanada (French title): El Desperado\nDenmark: Django, ulven fra Texas\nFrance: La boue, le massacre et le mort\nFrance: Le massacre et le sang\nGermany (DVD title): Django - Die im Schlamm verrecken\nGermany (DVD title): Django - die im Staub verrecken\nGreece (transliterated title): Texas desperados\nGreece: Βρώμικοι Παράνομοι\nPortugal: O Desesperado\nSpain: El desesperado\nUK: King of the West\nUSA: Big Ripoff\nUSA: The Dirty Outlaws\nWest Germany: Die im Staub verrecken\nWest Germany: Escondido\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Three Graves for a Winchester - Spaghetti Western - Ringo Carson has a tough life. First, he has a falling out with his best friend, Frank Sanders, after saving Jane, the girl he loves, from Mexican kidnappers in order to extort a ransom from her gunrunner father.\n\nThree Graves for a Winchester (1966)\nDirector: Emimmo Salvi\nWriters: James Wilde (story), Ambrogio Molteni \nStars: Gordon Mitchell, Mickey Hargitay, Milla Sannoner \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 24 July 1970 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 3 Bullets for Ringo \n\nStoryline:\nRingo Carson has a tough life. First, he has a falling out with his best friend, Frank Sanders, after saving Jane, the girl he loves, from Mexican kidnappers in order to extort a ransom from her gunrunner father. Frank goes off to the Civil War. Ringo reconciles with his estranged mother who needs his fast gun to protect her land from greedy land-grabber Daniels. Then Frank returns from...\n\nReviews:\n\"Ringo and his buddy Frank are two guns for hire, sent by a local businessman to retrieve his daughter from some pesky Mexican bandits. After shooting several hundred bandits and getting the daughter back, it turns out that Frank is in love with this chick, but she has the hots for Ringo, and they intend to marry. Following a punch up, Frank heads out of town and Ringo marries, settling down with his missus and becoming sheriff, also reconciling with his mum, who owns land that an evil banker wants at all costs.\n\nGot all that? It gets more complicated as war breaks out, Ringo gets blinded by accident and Frank takes over as sheriff in town, joining forces with the evil banker in order to get the land from Ringo's mum. When Ringo's mum gets killed and Ringo badly beaten, the blind guy goes on the warpath to bring everyone down, using his guns, his crazy friend, and a whole load of cannons and gunfire.\n\n3 Bullets for Ringo is solid Spaghetti Western madness. Every time Ringo goes into battle scores of bad guys get wasted, and there's a full on gun battle involving cannons in a cave system, and a climatic battle in town between the good guys and the bad guys, with the survivors literally stepping over all the corpses to get to each other.\n\nGordon Mitchell sure was ugly though, eh? Plus, fans of realism might want to stay away from this one though, as Ringo can gun down entire armies of bad guys without reloading or even using cover. As to be expected from an Italian film, everything looks great, especially the scene where three bad guys beat the crap out of Ringo and his family. There's also some sort of weird voodoo ceremony and the bad guys planning to roast Ringo's son over a fire. Fans of Spaghetti Westerns should track this one down. The opening credits are rather groovy too!\" Written by Bezenby on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Former hired gun Mickey Hargitay rescues his future wife from bandits, reconciles with his mother, becomes sheriff, and is blinded in the Civil War. He then finds himself clashing with a nasty banker and his old partner Gordon Mitchell, the town's new sheriff.\n\nDespite it's ultra-low budget, odd bits of humor, and very loose plot, I can't help but be entertained by this spaghetti western, in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to see overwrought muscle-men Hargitay and Mitchell chewing the scenery together in the same movie, though not nearly as much as Mickey did the previous year in the crackpot horror classic, The Bloody Pit Of Horror.\n\nThe filmmakers appear to have thrown in everything but the kitchen sink, including a Voodoo ceremony (!), actors named John Heston, and Spean Convery, and a fleeting character that appears to have been dubbed by an actor impersonating Jimmy Stewart!\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 3 colpi di Winchester per Ringo\nBrazil (DVD title): 3 balas para Ringo\nBrazil: Três Tiros de Ringo\nDenmark: Tre kugler til Ringos Winchester\nHungary: Ringo bosszúja\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Три пули для Ринго\nSweden: Winchester - Döden talar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Ringo'ya 3 el ateş\nUSA: Three Graves for a Winchester\nWest Germany: Drei Kugeln für Ringo\n 3 Bullets for Ringo\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Mary O'Donnell, a radical Irish journalist, wants to foment a peasant revolt in Mexico. She enlists the help of a seedy bandit, Lozoya, by saving him from a death sentence in Utah. They meet a man calling himself Prince Dmitri Vassilovich Orlowsky, who claims to be a Russian prince, not to mention a man of the cloth. Wallach pretends to be a Mexican folk hero. The trio crosses the border, the two men seeking a cache of gold while O'Donnell pursues her revolution. Lozoya has the key to the gold, but Nero knows where the other half of the map is.\n\nReviews:\n\"This one really needs a good DVD release. To my knowledge it's only available on an old VHS tape called DON'T TURN THE OTHER CHEEK, with animated asses (donkeys) wiggling their behinds, totally out of character with the film, which is an action filled Eurowestern by the director of the popular Ringo films, Duccio Tessari. Franco Nero plays another of his European adventurers, this time a Russian, who is seeking a lost treasure. Eli Wallach portrays another version of his popular \"Tuco\" character, this time once more a Mexican after playing the Greek version in ACE HIGH. Throw in Lynn Redgrave (slightly out of place in a spaghetti) as an Irish revolutionary and you have a film that is reminiscent of Sergio Corbucci's two popular political westerns THE MERCENARY (1968) and COMPANEROS (1970), both of which are superior to this.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): ¡Viva la muerte... tua!\nArgentina: ¡Viva la muerte... tuya!\nAustralia: Long Live ...

        "Description": "Full Western Movie: Bullets Don't Argue - On his own wedding day, sheriff Pat Garrett must leave and try to arrest two bank robbers. \n\nBullets Don't Argue (1964)\nDirector: Mario Caiano (as Fred Wilson, Manfred Riegert, Mike Perkins)\nWriters: Gianni Castellano (screenplay) (as Franz Wieland, Franz Waller), Giuseppe Moccia (screenplay) (as Daniel Mooch, Donald Mooch) \nStars: Rod Cameron, Ángel Aranda, Horst Frank \nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain | West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 October 1964 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Guns Don't Talk \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nOn his own wedding day, sheriff Pat Garrett must leave and try to arrest two bank robbers.\n\nReviews:\n\"This is the film that Jolly Films of Rome and the other producing companies were putting their hopes and money into while tossing a bone to an unknown director named Sergio Leone, giving him film ends and minimal financing to shoot a movie called The Magnificent Stranger which featured a little-known American TV actor named Clint Eastwood. BULLETS DON'T ARGUE starred Rod Cameron, a bigger name, as Pat Garrett, with Horst Frank and Angel Aranda as Billy and George Clanton, thus mixing two old west legends into a very typically American spaghetti western. It kind of reminded me of the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott westerns of the late fifties, with Cameron as the stoic, older authority figure bringing in the wild, younger outlaws, and is pretty darned good, doing what it sets out to do. Oddly enough the highlight of Morricone's score is the song Lonesome Billy, about the elder of the outlaw brothers. BTW I think this is the film that did so poorly at the Italian box office that it prompted Variety to report that spaghetti westerns were dead, a week or so before the Leone/Eastwood film, retitled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, turned the film world on its ear.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\n\"This film is a ripping off of American westerns. When I say ripping off I don't mean it is a poor film. It has the typical western elements: sheriffs and bandits. The role of the characters is well defined and at the end of the story the good will triumph on bad. Many films-loving people didn't understand why this film hadn't had success in Italy. First of all it was played by unknown actors, at least in Italy. Moreover, westerns were getting to be on the wane from 1965. But the main reason is that Italians were bored about classic westerns (\"the stagecoach\", \"Rio Grande\", \"Cimarron\", \"saddle the wind\" etc) they preferred action, shootings and a bit of violence. So the film \"a fistful of dollars\" released a few weeks later was a great success because it started a new era of making westerns as Italians preferred.\n\nThis was one of the first westerns to have false names of director and actors so as to make it seem like an American film. Probably it was shot without recording the audio even if many actors spoke English. It was released in Italian and in English both dubbed. Rod Cameron dubbed himself.\" Written by entomol71 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Le pistole non discutono\nAustria: Die letzten Zwei vom Rio Bravo\nBelgium (French title) (dubbed version): Colt et dollars\nBrazil: As Pistolas não Discutem\nDenmark: De sidste to fra Rio Bravo\nFrance: Mon colt fait la loi\nGreece (transliterated title): Ta pistolia den pairnoun apo logia\nSpain: Las pistolas no discuten\nSweden: 30,000 fördömda dollars\nUSA: Bullets Don't Argue\nUSA: Pistols Don't Argue\nWest Germany: Die letzten Zwei vom Rio Bravo\nWorld-wide (English title) (informal title): Bullets Don't Lie\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Revolveri odlucuju\n Guns Don't Talk\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Into the mix rides seemingly mysterious stranger Anthony Steffan, who looks like a dandy but has a few deadly tricks up his sleeve.\n\nThough derivative of about a thousand other Italian westerns, Gentleman Killer has a lot of rousing action and fast gun play, making it worthwhile, if not essential viewing and very easy to forgive whatever flaws there are.\n\nThe bandit leader is played by Spanish actor Eduardo Fajardo, whom fans of the genre should recognize from his role as the psychotic ex-Confederate in Sergio Corbucci's Django. He's pretty good here too and quite a scene-stealer.\n\nThere's also great score by Ennio Morricone's frequent conductor Bruno Nicolai. This time, Nicolai and Morricone trade places, with Ennio taking control of the orchestra.\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com. \n\n\"Shamango (a.k.a. \"Joe\" depending on which dubbed version you watch) comes into a town where Mexican bandits try to control. He seems to be a weakling everybody's making fun of, but gets really mean after a few insults. Doesn't sound new, because there is nothing new. But: this a perfect little genre movie, no disappointments, well worth spending 90 minutes of your precious time on. The actors Anthony Steffen as Shamango and Eduardo Fajardo as the Mexican colonel (with an evil grin that makes crocodiles give up their job) are doing well, so is Bruno Nicolai with his powerful music and cameraman Francisco Marin with his sinister pictures.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Gentleman Jo... uccidi\nBrazil: Gentleman Jo...

Later, he is captured, sentenced, and is about to be hanged - but he never profited from Wang's death- only finding the photographs of his four widows and a fortune cookie. Meanwhile, Lo comes to America in search of his uncle's fortune after his family is held hostage. He frees Dakota from the Hangman, since he's the only one who can help find Wang's fortune. Now, the difficult part will really start... the Treasure hunt. First they need to locate the four clues, a tattoo on each of Wang's widow's butts, then uncover the fortune while being hunted by a religious fanatic/ ex-confederate soldier who is on to their game.\n\nReview:\n\"Blood Money\", also known as \"The Stranger and the Gunfighter\", is an interesting combination of gun play and flying fists. Lee VanCleef may not be at the top of his game, but the unusual and entertaining story makes up for any edge he might have lost. I found more humor here than in any of the \"Trinity\" films. If you look at the entertainment value alone, I would say this is about on a par with \"Death Rides a Horse\" or \"Kid Vengeance\". It is definitely inferior to \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\", \"For a Few Dollars More\", and \"The Big Gundown\". Overall, I would recommend \"Blood Money\" as a must see for Lee VanCleef fans. - MERK\" Written by merklekranz on IMDb.com \n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Spaghetti Western in Full Length: The Mercenary - A greedy Polish mercenary aids a mine worker and peasant girl as they lead a revolution against the oppressive Mexican Government, and are pursued by an American rival.\n\nThe Mercenary (1968)\nDirector: Sergio Corbucci\nWriters: Franco Solinas (story), Giorgio Arlorio (story)\nStars: Franco Nero, Tony Musante, Franco Giacobini\nGenre: Comedy, Western\nRuntime: 1h 45min\nCountry: Italy | Spain | USA\nLanguage: English | Italian | Spanish\nFilming Locations: Madrid, Spain\nAlso Known As: Il mercenario (original title)\n\nStoryline:\nWhile a Mexican revolutionary lies low as a U.S. rodeo clown, the cynical Polish mercenary who tutored the idealistic peasant tells how he and a dedicated female radical fought for the soul of the guerrilla general Paco, as Mexicans threw off repressive government and all-powerful landowners in the 1910s. Tracked by the vengeful Curly, Paco liberates villages, but is tempted by social banditry's treasures, which Kowalski revels in.\n\nReviews:\nI recently got hold of the Japanese DVD print via ebay. This is of really high quality and I was amazed that this film is not more widely known or appreciated. What a brilliant film. In many ways it is similar to Companeros and if you liked that wonderful film you will also love this. The story is somewhat far-fetched but is very enjoyable and fast paced in a 'boys own' way. The machine gun makes its familiar appearance. Franco Nero, as always, delivers a superb performance and Jack Palance gives a very good performance as a very unpleasant killer. The music is brilliant and the duel in the bullring is incomparable and is perfectly choreographed to the wonderful music. If you are interested in westerns you have to see this film. Written by washboard via IMDb.com\n\n\"The second collaboration of Sergio Corbucci, the Italian Western's most important director besides Sergio Leone, and Franco Nero, one of the genre's greatest actors, after the ingenious \"Django\" from 1966, \"Il Mercenario\", a movie set in the time of the Mexican revolution, and therefore late for a Western, is a must-see for every fan of the genre.\n\nSergei Kowalski (Franco Nero) gets hired by short-tempered revolutionary Paco Roman (Tony Musante), in order to help his squad of unexperienced rebels with their campaign for a free Mexico. While Paco is a crook, but also an idealist, becoming more and more idealistic after his troop is joined by beautiful and idealistic Columba, a woman whose father was a revolutionary , the Polish is a typical anti-hero, witty and cool and somehow sympathetic, but mainly concerned on his own benefit.\n\nThe acting is great, specially Franco Nero as the Polish, and Jack Palance's performance as one of the villains. Another villain is played by Eduardo Fajardo, who played the villainous Major Jackson in Django. The score of this movie, composed by Ennio Morricone, is just brilliant (how couldn't it), the cinematography is great as well as the locations. My favorite film by Corbucci is still the incomparably brilliant \"Il Grande Silenzio\" (\"aka. \"The Great Silence\") of 1968, \"Django\" of 1966 being my second-favorite due to its immense entertainment- and cult-value. Maybe not quite as brilliant as \"Il Grande Silenzio\" and not quite as influential as \"Django\", \"Il Mercenario\" is nonetheless an exceptional Spaghetti Western with a great sense of humor that I would recommend to everybody, not only genre fans. 9 out of 10!\" Written by Witchfinder-General-666 via IMDb.com\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwestern\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Written by Tom Seldon\n\nReview:\n\"I am a big fan of westerns, especially spaghetti, some are above average and i think this is one of them. It has a good, well thought out story and there is plenty of action and gun-play, ( fist fights and shoot outs ) to keep your attention. I also think the actors playing Django ( Tony Kendall ) and Sartana (George Ardisson ) are very good. The actual plot keeps you hooked and there are also a few surprises along the way. One thing i really liked was the rousing music score and the title song. There are of course many Django and Sartana movies some very good, some not so good, i have seen most of them and i think that, this is, one of the better one's and would recommend that if you get the chance, catch it.\" Written By wdb-3 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Django sfida Sartana\nBrazil: Django Desafia Sartana\nCanada (French title): Django sfida Sartana\nDenmark: Django mod Sartana\nFinland: Savuavat revolverit\nFrance: Django défie Sartana\nGermany: Django sfida Sartana\nGreece (transliterated title): O Django prokalei ton Sartana\nGreece (video title): Django enantion Sartana\nNetherlands: Django contra Sartana\nNorway: Django utfodrer Sartana!\nPortugal: Django Desafia Sartana\nSpain: Django desafía a Sartana\nSweden (video box title): Rykande revolvrar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Omuz omuza\nUSA: Django Defies Sartana\n Django Against Sartana\n Django Challenges Sartana\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #westernmovie #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Because he is not offered enough money, he decides to join forces with the bandit but he's double-crossed by the ruthless villain.\n\nReviews:\n\"Acceptable twilight Spaghetti Western with interesting dialogue by the usual writer Ernesto Gastaldi , splendid cinematography by Zanni and memorable musical score by Nora Orlandi . It is a typical Spaghetti Western in which blends the common scenarios , as invincible and tough antiheroes , complex as well as fast showdowns with numerous casualties , impulsive and quick zooms , and musical score with Morricone influence . The picture has a certain remembrance to ¨For a fistful dollars more¨ (Sergio Leone) regarding the avenging theme and including Manuel character who bears remarkable resemblance to Indio role (Gian Maria Volonte) ; furthermore , Claudio Camaso was brother of Volonte and holding physical likeness and similar playing . Besides , good set decoration filmed in Elios studios and , of course , Almeria (Spain) . It also bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Django¨ (Sergio Corbucci) regarding 'the Saloon girl character' , equally interpreted by Loredana Nusciak . The highlights of the movie result to be the followings : when the hero wakes up from the beach along with a corpse , Django living in a photography back room studio decorated against posters captioning ¨Wanted : Dead or alive¨ , the phantom village full of dust and wind and Django buried until neck , among others . ¨Ten thousand dollars blood money¨ was shot at the same time to ¨For one hundred thousand dollars per killing (by Giovanni Fago)¨ with similar artist and technician team and also starred by Gianni Garco , Claudio Camaso and Fernando Sancho . The motion picture finely produced by Mino Loy , Luciano and Sergio Martino brothers was well directed by Romolo Guerrieri who also made other Pasta Westerns . Romolo is a good craftsman who has directed all type of genres such as post-nuke Sci-fi as ¨ The last warrior¨ , Italian crime or Poliziottesco as \"Young, Violent, Dangerous\" , ¨City under siege¨ , \"Ring of Death\" and westerns as ¨Johnny Yuma¨ and ¨Seven guns for Timothy¨ again with Fernando Sancho .

        "Description": "Free Spaghetti Western: 15 Scaffolds for a Murderer - Spaghetti Western - Accused of a hideous crime they did not commit, the members of two rivaling gangs, persecuted by a bloodthirsty lynch mob, take refuge in an abandoned fort, taking two hostages with them. \n\n15 Scaffolds for a Murderer (1967)\nDirector: Nunzio Malasomma\nWriters: Mario di Nardo (story), José Luis Bayonas (screenplay) (as José Luis de las Bayonas)\nStars: Craig Hill, Susy Andersen, Aldo Sambrell \nGenres: Action | Drama | Mystery | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 18 April 1969 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 15 Forcas para um Assassino \nFilming Locations: Dear Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA number of thugs from two different gangs are evading capture by all means. The city prepares fifteen gallows, believing their harsh, cruel Sheriff will manage to do it. The two gang leaders unite, many men fall in gunfights, three women are murdered, but the end is a surprise to all.\n\nReviews:\n\"An Italian-Spanish co-production full of action , exaggerated characters, shootouts and loads of violence . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . There's also an interesting intrigue and whodunit with some Giallo when happens a killing spree , and the question is : Who is the killer ? For money, for pleasure, for revenge, he doesn't care why he kills or how ¡ . A family formed by a mother (Margarita Lozano) and two daughters (Eleonora Brown) is cruelly killed and are accused two different bands who are facing each other . One gang (Jose Canalejas) is led by Billy Mack (Graig Hill) and another one (Frank Braña) is commanded by Sandy Cassel (George Martin) . When the fiancé named Bud Lee (Howard Ross) of a murdered girl learns the slaughter and atrocity committed he executes a single-handedly revenge , ravages and kills each person involved in the massacre . Bud is relentless in his vendetta , deadly in his violence . Then the two bands flee and go to the town which is inhabited by important people as the Sheriff ( Antonio Molino Rojo) , the banker , the priest (Andrea Bosic), the doctor (Umberto Raho) and a gorgeous Pastor's priest named Barbara Ferguson (Susy Andersen) , among others . But Barbara is kidnapped as hostage and the bandits get away to Mexico . They arrive in a Mexican village but are besieged by a posse (Antonio Molino , Aldo Sambrell , Alvaro De Luna) formed to chase them . There takes place violent fights , facing off , hangings and final surprise about the killer's identity .\n\nIt's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Graig Hill and George Martin and his hoodlums . Both of whom are fine , they ravage the screen, kill , shoot , hit and run , besides receive violent punches, kicks and hitting . Aldo Sambrell as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, he subsequently would play very secondary or minimum characters . Furthermore, there appears usual Italian/Spanish Western secondaries as Alvaro De Luna, Rafael Albaicin, Jose Canalejas , Antonio Molino Rojo , Ricardo Palacios , Jose Luis Martin and of course Frank Braña . The film blends violence , blood , tension , high body-count and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the final gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion. \" Written by ma-cortes on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 15 forche per un assassino\nBrazil: 15 Forcas para um Assassino\nFrance: 15 potences pour un salopard\nFrance (alternative spelling): Quinze potences pour un salopard\nGreece (transliterated title): Dekapente aghones gia ena dolofono\nPortugal: A Um Passo da Forca\nSpain (poster title): Quince horcas para un asesino\nSpain: 15 horcas para un asesino\nUSA (alternative spelling): Fifteen Scaffolds for the Killer\nUSA: 15 Scaffolds for a Murderer\nUSA (video title): The Dirty Fifteen\nWest Germany: Die schmutzigen Dreizehn\nWest Germany (video title): Dirty Buster's\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "Brother Outlaw | SPAGHETTI WESTERN | Cowboy Film | Action",
        "Description": "Free Cowboy Film: Brother Outlaw - A man is falsely charged with bank robbery, prompting his brother to break him out of prison.\n\nBrother Outlaw (1971)\nDirector: Edoardo Mulargia (as Edward G. Muller)\nWriters: Alessandro Schirò (story) (as Alessandro Schiro), Alessandro Schirò (screenplay) (as Alessandro Schiro)\nStars: Tony Kendall, James Rogers, Sophia Kammara\nGenres: Western, Action\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 19 February 1971 (Italy) \nFilming Locations: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA man is falsely charged with bank robbery, prompting his brother to break him out of prison. Together the pair set out to find the real culprits, and their search leads them to a gang of outlaws headed by a notorious gunfighter.\n\nReview:\n\"BROTHER OUTLAW is a solid if unspectacular addition to the spaghetti western genre, directed by Eoardo Mulargia, who previously made DON'T WAIT, DJANGO...SHOOT! amongst many other entries in the genre. Thankfully it's much better than the aforementioned film, thanks to a well-paced narrative, plenty of well-directed action, and an interesting plot. It's clear that Mulargia learnt plenty since that earlier western he shot.\n\nThe good-looking Tony Kendall plays Dakota, the Sheriff of a small town assailed by bank robbers. This dastardly criminal gang successfully manage to pin the blame for their latest crime on the sheriff, whom is promptly shipped off to a hard labour camp for x amount of years. Thankfully for him his brother is a real outlaw and breaks him out of the camp so that the pair can track down and bring justice to the real culprits.\n\nThis is an affectionately-made western with all the usual tropes of the genre: the opening stage coach chase (which goes on for about ten minutes but feels like an hour), the hero getting captured and beaten and escaping, lots of duels, shoot-outs and people getting shot off horses, plus some very nice location photography with Italian landscapes standing in for the Old West. Kendall was always an adept hero and he's well supported by a game cast. BROTHER OUTLAW is no classic but it's certainly an entertaining enough entry in a crowded genre.\" Written by Leofwine_draca on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Rimase uno solo e fu la morte per tutti!\nBrazil Fico Só Mas Mato Todos\nBrazil Irmãos Fora da Lei (reissue title)\nChile Dakota solo y fuera de la ley\nFinland Lainsuojaton (video box title)\nFrance Creuse ta fosse, j'aurai ta peau\nFrance Le pistolero de Tombstone\nItaly Rimase uno solo e fu la morte per tutti!\nItaly Senza Respiro(Working Title)\nNorway Duell i Tombstone\nSpain Quedó uno solo, la muerte fue para todos\nSpain Quedó uno solo... la muerte fué para todos(DVD Title)\nSweden Duell i Tombstone(Video Title)\nUnited Kingdom Brother's Outlaw(TV listings title)\nUnited Kingdom Rimase uno solo e fu morte per tutti(TV Title)\nUnited States Brother Outlaw\nWest Germany Dakota - Nur der Colt war sein Gesetz\nWest Germany Schwur des Geächteten(Video Title)\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Full Western for free: Bounty Hunter in Trinity - The townsfolk of Trinity decide to hire a notorious bounty hunter to protect them from a fierce band of Mexican outlaws who are terrorizing the area.\n\nBounty Hunter in Trinity (1972)\nDirectors: Oscar Santaniello (as Oskar Faradine), Joe D'Amato (uncredited)\nWriters: Joe D'Amato (as Aristide Massaccesi), Romano Scandariato\nStars: Jeff Cameron, Enzo Pulcrano, Attilio Dottesio \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 December 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: A Bounty Killer for Trinity \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nThe townsfolk of Trinity decide to hire a notorious bounty hunter to protect them from a fierce band of Mexican outlaws who are terrorizing the area. He discovers the true person behind the bandits is within the town. A bloody gunfight ends the control of the gang and returns control of the town to its people.\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"A BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is a grim, dark, violent little movie which turned out better than it probably had to be. This is another one of those ultra low budget Italian Westerns filmed on the ramshackle sets & familiar gravel pit owned and made by genre star Gordon Mitchell with his own resources and bare hands that served as the backdrop for about three dozen similar efforts made between 1970 and 1973 or so, a story that is actually more inspiring than the interchangeable threadbare plots of the films themselves.\n\nDirectors like Joe D'amato, Miles Deem, Frank Kramer and Anthony Ascott used the sets and outdoor locations like a Holodeck, creating worlds & places out of nothing. Costs were kept at a minimum with friends or co-workers pitching in with production crew work or bit parts, with a \"stock\" cast of actors brought in to fill the speaking roles. This week someone would play the gunslinger, next week they would be the Padre or maybe a crooked sheriff.\n\nA BOUNTY KILLER FOR TRINITY is actually one of the better efforts, with \"Jeff Cameron\" cast as a laconic, remorseless and highly efficient bounty killer hired by the scheming bigwigs of a tumbleweed nowhere to rid their budding community of some local Banditos who have the run of the place and are making their lives miserable -- see also Corbucci's NAVAJO JOE and TOM HORN with Steve McQueen for other examples of this premise. As with most Euro Westerns the lead anti-hero is armed with a clever killing contraption (ala Sabata's shotgun pistol) and this time it is a crossbow, with throwing knives, Derringer pistols, a sawed off shotgun, as well good old six shooters & Winchester repeaters also coming into play depending upon what would make a better shot. Here is an equal opportunity minded hired assassin.\n\nJeff Cameron is very good in the lead, bringing a sense of quiet disappointment and weariness about having to kill another bunch of sadistic brutes, with an ending that is actually rather evocative of DIRTY HARRY -- He takes no pride in his actions (unlike a wisecracking Sartana or ultra-cool Clint Eastwood), carries a sheaf of wanted posters for reference to make sure he is killing the right people and what the going rate is for their heads, and mastered the ability to roll a cigarette using tobacco tucked into a vest pocket for his performance. The film still has the comic book mentality of a good Anthony Ascott Spaghetti, but the affair is tinged with an air of regret for the loss of life, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that usually has a gleeful, sadistic attitude about violence and death.\" Written by Squonkamatic on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Un bounty killer a Trinità\nBrazil: Matem Trinity\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Един ловец на глави в Тринита\nEurope (English title) (literal title): A Bounty Killer for Trinity\nGreece (video title): Gia mia houfta katharmata\nUSA: Bounty Hunter in Trinity\nWest Germany: Kopfgeld für einen Killer\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Eurocult cinema veteran George Martin stars as a tough trapper on a revenge mission after the authorities murder his brother. Beautiful landscapes, great cast, lots of shootouts, fun fight scenes (including a knife fight between two gorgeous women in a cabin), thrilling horseback pursuits, and an impressively staged final battle between trappers and police with tons of extras and cool stunts. No sleaze or brutal violence, though the body count is quite high, but still highly entertaining and worthy of repeat watches. Earlier this year, MVD released this on blu in the US with an excellent looking transfer. This definitely makes me want to check out Ossorio's other western, Tomb of the Pistolero (1964).\"\n- written by \"Videoverdose\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) I tre del Colorado\nAustria (dubbed version) Wölfe der svhwarzen Berge\nBelgium (Flemish title) (original subtitled version) Bereden politie\nBelgium (French title) Les rebelles du Canada\nBrazil Pistoleiros do Colorado\nCanada (English title) Hudson River Massacre\nFrance Massacre à Hudson River\nFrance La frontière de la haine\nFrance (video title) Les tuniques rouges\nFrance (video title) Massacre d'Hudson River\nFrance (video title) Police Monté\nGreece (transliterated title) Oi antartes tou Colorado\nIndia (English title) I Tre Del Colorado\nItaly I tre del Colorado\nSpain Rebeldes en Canadá\nUK Canadian Wilderness\nUSA (informal literal title) Rebels in Canada\nUSA (informal title) Revolt in Canada\nUSA (informal literal title) Three from Colorado\nUSA (DVD title) Hudson River Massacre\nWest Germany Die Unversöhnlichen\nWest Germany (video title) Gnadenlose Killer\nWest Germany Drei aus Colorado\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #cowboymovies\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

As a game, and as part of an attempt to be taken more seriously by the adults in town, Kid Terror O’Hara decides he and his friends will rob the bank themselves.\nIn a complex plan that includes diversions, padded wagon wheels, explosives made from gunpowder and butter, and smuggling the smallest child into the bank in a piece of luggage, the children succeed.\nThey hadn’t counted on the outlaws looking for revenge once they realize someone got to the gold before they did.\nNor had Kid Terror and his friends quite figured out how they would tell the town sheriff what really happened at the bank. \n\nReviews:\n\"Give this film a chance, and you might be pleasantly surprised. I went into it with empty gun expectations and wound up laughing more than at the far majority of the Spaghetti West comedies.\n\nSome of the humor is crude. Offering the outlaws warm beer, Kid Terror has the child with the weakest bladder slip behind the bar and pee in two mugs.\n\nBut there are some genuinely clever moments — and dialogue — too. These kids have more moxie and ingenuity than they know what to do with.\n\nThere’s also a subplot with lots of familiar faces.

The characters are very amusing especially Tomas Milian who gives us a beautiful interpretation of a funny sort of bounty killer called \"Provvidenza\". This movie will make you laugh a lot without be vulgar or foregone. Least but not last the nice soundtrack by Ennio Morricone will remain stamped in your mind!\" Written by Dr. Vornoff on IMDb.com\n\n\"\"Death Rides A Horse\" director Giulio Petroni's \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" is a slapstick Spaghetti western comedy that is nothing like his other westerns. Genre stalwart Tomas Milian plays a mustached bounty hunter named Providence. He wears his derby so low that it crimps his ears with comic results. He speaks with a weird nasal lisp and looks incredibly buffoonish in his suit and tie with gloves. He travels around in a modified Wells Fargo stagecoach. Paunchy American character actor Greg Palmer co-stars with Milian in his silly frontier saga. He plays a thick-headed outlaw called the Hurricane Kid. Six scenarists, including Franco Castellano, Günter Ebert, Antonino Marino, Giuseppe Moccia, Antoinette Pellevant , and Piero Regnoli, along with Petroni himself have fashioned a lowest common denominator comedy not unlike the \"Trinity\" movies. Palmer makes a perfect Bud Spencer type, while Milian hams it up as an umbrella-toting bounty hunter who wields a derringer with a deadly accurate aim. When they are playing everything for laughs, the filmmakers appropriate the plot from Leone's \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" as Providence brings Hurricane in for the reward money and then engineers Hurricane's subsequent escape so they can pull the same stunt again. \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" appears to have been lensed in Italy rather than Spain since we never see any of those distinctive Spanish mountains. In other words, most everything looks green. Tomas Milian is nothing like you've ever seen him in a Spaghetti western. Incredibly, this unprepossessing oater boasts a musical score performed by Ennio Morricone. There are some interesting gags, especially the game of pool. Difficult as it is to believe this farce actually spawned a sequel the following year entitled \"Here We Go Again, Eh Providence?\" Milian and Palmer both reprised their roles. Italian tough guy stunt man Giovanni Cianfriglia plays a card-sharp thug who is roundly trounced in that hilarious pool tournament with Providence. Mind you, only fans of the Marx Brothers will appreciate a gag about tw0-third of the way through the film that is a variation on a Frank Tashlin gag from \"A Night in Casablanca.\" Harpo is leaning against a building when a French policeman asks him if he (Harpo) thinks that he is holding up the building. Harpo nods with an impish grin, steps away from the building and the edifice collapses. Hurricane is leaning against a tree when Providence asks him a similar question. Hurricane steps away from the tree and it keels over and hits the ground. Altogether, \"Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?\" shows not only Tomas Milian in a different light but also director Giulio Petroni in an entirely different light. \" Written by zardoz-13 on IMDb.com\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Thunder Over El Paso - An outlaw and a bounty hunter are searching for Mexican bandit Corbancho, who is running the El Paso area, and has also robbed the Bank of Tuscon of $400,000.\n\nThunder Over El Paso (1972)\nDirector: Roberto Bianchi Montero (as Roberto B. Montero)\nWriters: Arpad DeRiso (screenplay), Maurizio Pradeaux (screenplay) \nStars: Antonio Sabato, Chris Avram, Erika Blanc \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 February 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Il était une fois à El Paso \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nAn outlaw and a bounty hunter are searching for Mexican bandit Corbancho, who is running the El Paso area, and has also robbed the Bank of Tuscon of $400,000. The bounty hunter is after the reward, while the other seek vengeance.\n\nReviews:\n\"Oh sure, as far as film goes, it's awful. But if you adore Italian produced spaghetti westerns as much as I do Roberto Montero's THUNDER OVER EL PASO (as the version I saw was titled) is pretty much everything fans of Italo Westerns watch them for. Cynical anti-heroes, offbeat locations, low-rent production values, atmospheric photography, some pretty Euro damsels ready to hop in bed with the lead actor and a healthy, bone crunching quota of violence ruthlessly dished out. Plus a compelling little musical score, this one an upbeat harmonica led folker by Carlo Savina.\n\nPolizichetti tough guy actor Antonio Sabato joins forces with Chris Avram as a pair of surprisingly vicious black hat heroes who go after a big greasy pistolero boss and his gang of cutthroats who nabbed $200,000 in gold bars. So much for the plot; The rest of the movie is an enjoyable if forgettable mish-mash of shootings, beatings, knife throwing, jail breaks, showdowns, plots, counter-plots and a few minutes cozying up with jaw droppingly beautiful Pilar Velazquez. Her pickup line \"I'm 18 and I know what I like!\" would work on me too.\n\nDirector Roberto Bianchi Montero is perhaps better known for his Giallo exploitation masterpiece SO SWEET SO DEAD and demonstrates a similar skill at moving the plot forward. The pace never drags and while nothing overtly spectacular or memorable happens the movie never pushes a wrong button. Even the requisite Torture Scene is over & done with without much fuss, and interestingly is inflicted by the protagonists rather than on them. Here are two guys who'd waterboard somebody without thinking about it, the only difference between themselves & the villain being that they get to score with the leading ladies.\n\nOne interesting aspect about the film is that it's pretty much an all Italian affair with no imported big-name Yankee star. Then again by 1972 the Italians no longer felt the urgency to have a recognizable name for the American markets and just got on with the business at hand of making their movies. Also for a 1972 spaghetti western it is notable for not having a comedy formula ala the Trinity films, and instead focuses squarely on the juvenile fantasy & violence angle.

The Man's Mine (1969)\nDirector: Edoardo Mulargia (as Edward G.

Their target, a drunkard and fed up with living, is roused to action after they murder his girlfriend, Rosie.\n\nReviews: \n\"\"La taglia è tua... l'uomo l'ammazzo io\" (1969), more commonly known as \"El Puro\", is a Spaghetti Western directed by Edoardo Mulargia. The plot is straightforward: the once infamous gunfighter \"El Puro\" (played by Robert Woods) is now a drunkard hunted by bandits for the $10,000 reward on his head. This looks to have been cheap to make, with limited interiors which are used quite a lot. But these sets look fairly realistic as they are filthy and grubby which gives in an authentic touch of the West. The camera-work by Antonio L. Ballesteros is mainly devoid of style, apart from a few crash-zooms. The editing is rough and hasty, with more than a few jarring cuts. The direction is more spirited, with a well staged gunfight and an excellently handled climax and manages to make some of the more slower scenes interesting enough at least to watch instead of skipping them and getting to the highlights. The acting is good in places, even if Robert Woods performance as \"El Puro\" is slightly disappointing after seeing his great role in \"Black Jack\" (1968), but Mario Brega, Marc Fiorini (as Ashborn Hamilton Jr.) and Maurizio Bonuglia acquit themselves well to there roles as the villains of the picture. All in all, you should enjoy it if you are a fan of the genre.\" Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): La taglia è tua... l'uomo l'ammazzo io\nBrazil: El Puro - O Procurado\nBrazil: Pecos Acerta as Contas\nFrance: El Puro, la rançon est pour toi\nSpain: El Puro se sienta, espera y dispara\n El puro\n The Reward's Yours...

The underlying politics is thick and serious and contemporary to its time. The cast is...did I say fun...not to mention extremely talented actors doing some of their best work.

        "Description": "Scalps - The commander of a Texan fort in the Civil War refuses to surrender to the Northerners, and tries to buy the local Indian tribe chief's daughter. The sage man refuses, and the Southerners massacre the tribe and abduct the young squaw anyway. The noble squaw manages to escape, and hides out with a rough rancher, who dislikes Indians, but hates the Southerners more. The odd couple joins forces, and tactics, to exert ultimate vengeance on the men at the fort.\n\nScalps (1987)\nDirector: Claudio Fragasso, Bruno Mattei\nWriters: Italo Gasperini(story), Richard Harrison(story), Bruno Mattei(screenplay)\nStars: Vassili Karis, Mapi Galán, Alberto Farnese\nGenre: Western, Action, Drama\nCountry: Italy, Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 14 October 1987 (France)\nFilming Location: Incir De Paolis Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nReviews:\n\"Not a bad one for Mattei. Released at the same time with White Apache, and according to rumors with more input by Mattei (who apparently directed most of this film) than on White Apache.\n\nLots of bad dialogue of course, but that was more or less expected. The music was for certain parts quite good, in the vein of older spaghettis but during other parts awful with more modern (whatever) flavor.\n\nThe film was certainly watchable, much better than, for instance, Zombi 3 which he \"Co-directed\" when Fulci was away for one or other reason. Mattei also tried here for some parts (usually in vein, though) to create this into a some kind of 'drama' film which was not so successful.\n\nI have no idea about which version is uncut and which one is not, the version I saw was on Greek video.\n\nIf you find this one somewhere, check it out. It's not that bad as it is rumored to be (depending on your tastes, of course). I enjoyed it anyway.\"\n- written by \"thomas-sundback\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Scalps\nBrazil Escalpo\nFinland Päänahat\nFrance Scalps\nGreece Scalps\nHungary Véres skalpok\nItaly Scalps\nPortugal Yarin, a Índia Vingadora\nSoviet Union (Russian title) Скальпы\nSpain (promotional title) ¡Scalps!

        "Title": "Lightning Jack | PAUL HOGAN",
        "Description": "Lightning Jack - Lightning Jack Kane is an Australian outlaw in the wild west. During a bungled bank robbery he picks up mute Ben Doyle as a hostage. The two become good friends, with Jack teaching Ben how to rob banks, while they plan Jack's last heist. \n\nLightning Jack (1994)\nDirector: Simon Wincer\nWriter: Paul Hogan\nStars: Paul Hogan, Cuba Gooding Jr., Beverly D'Angelo\nGenres: Comedy, Western\nCountry: USA, Australia\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 March 1994 (USA)\nFilming Locations: Monument Valley, Arizona, USA \n\nStoryline:\nPaul Hogan plays Lightning Jack Kane, a long-sighted Australian outlaw in the American west, with his horse, Mate. After the rest of his g*ng is killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, Jack survives only to read of the events in the newspaper that he was nothing next to others. Annoyed at not being recognised as an outlaw, Jack attempts a robbery by himself, and ends up taking young mute Ben Doyle (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as a hostage. He later discovers that, tired of never having been treated with respect due to his disability, Ben wishes to join him.\n\nJack attempts to teach Ben how to fire a gun and rob banks, with his first attempt at \"on-the-job\" training ending with Ben shooting himself in the foot. Across the course of the training, they pay occasional visits to saloons where Jack shows Ben the truth about adult life, including helping him to lose his virginity. However, the true nature of the saloon visits is for Jack to make contact with showgirl Lana Castel (Beverly D'Angelo), who, unbeknownst to Jack, is madly in love with him.\n\nWhen Ben's training is complete, the two learn of a bank which is said the entire town armed and ready to protect it. Jack sees this as the test he has been waiting for, and together they hatch a plan to rob it. Everything seems to be going smoothly and they are set to begin, until Jack discovers that a rival g*ng of outlaws is also planning to rob the bank. He is prepared to give up when Ben has a plan of his own.\n\nBen silently tips off the townspeople, who quickly swarm the bank with the rival outlaws inside. The g*ng are arrested and the entire town celebrates, allowing Jack and Ben to slip unnoticed into the bank and swiftly strip it clean. Before leaving, Jack jumps into the celebrations, ensuring that his grinning face is seen at the top of the town photo. By the time the true robbery is discovered, the two - and Lana - are gone, with a bounty of thousands on their heads and all of America searching for them - the life that Jack had always wanted.\n\nUser Reviews (IMDb.com):\n\"This is a comedy set in the old west. Even if it's not your favorite movie genre, it's worth watching if for no reason than the amazing acting by Cuba Gooding, Jr. It takes a talented actor to give such a strong performance without a single word of dialogue. Paul Hogan is as adorable as ever, although the role of Lightning Jack Kane doesn't differ much from his Crocodile Mick Dundee character. The supporting cast nicely fills out the roster of characters. I recommend this film for its light, entertaining value.\" Written by cheryl-142-917207\n\n\"Beautiful work by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this Western comedy with beloved Aussie hero (who also directs). All heart, but includes the necessary sweaty grimy sinister bad guys and violence. Lots of horses. (Great film to work for as a wrangler.) Also the gorgeous witty professional women. And Native American medicine. Good as a break from the daily grind.\" Written by abi_sheldon\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

(1971)\nDirector: Duccio Tessari\nWriters: Dino Maiuri (screenplay), Massimo De Rita (screenplay)\nStars: Franco Nero, Eli Wallach, Lynn Redgrave\nGenres: Action | Adventure | Comedy | War | Western \nCountry: Italy | West Germany | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 12 April 1972 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: ¡Viva la muerte... tuya! \nFilming Locations: Incir De Paolis Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nA spaghetti western in which three adventurers team up during the Mexican Revolution. Mary O'Donnell, a radical Irish journalist, wants to foment a peasant revolt in Mexico. She enlists the help of a seedy bandit, Lozoya, by saving him from a death sentence in Utah. They meet a man calling himself Prince Dmitri Vassilovich Orlowsky, who claims to be a Russian prince, not to mention a man of the cloth. Wallach pretends to be a Mexican folk hero. The trio crosses the border, the two men seeking a cache of gold while O'Donnell pursues her revolution. Lozoya has the key to the gold, but Nero knows where the other half of the map is.\n\nReviews:\n\"This one really needs a good DVD release. To my knowledge it's only available on an old VHS tape called DON'T TURN THE OTHER CHEEK, with animated asses (donkeys) wiggling their behinds, totally out of character with the film, which is an action filled Eurowestern by the director of the popular Ringo films, Duccio Tessari. Franco Nero plays another of his European adventurers, this time a Russian, who is seeking a lost treasure. Eli Wallach portrays another version of his popular \"Tuco\" character, this time once more a Mexican after playing the Greek version in ACE HIGH. Throw in Lynn Redgrave (slightly out of place in a spaghetti) as an Irish revolutionary and you have a film that is reminiscent of Sergio Corbucci's two popular political westerns THE MERCENARY (1968) and COMPANEROS (1970), both of which are superior to this.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): ¡Viva la muerte... tua!\nArgentina: ¡Viva la muerte... tuya!\nAustralia: Long Live ...

It is said that the gang under the lead of Corbett has committed the crime. Jim now goes for revenge but things turn out to be more complicated than he originally thought. To get some money he accepts the job as a sheriff. Written by cengelm\n\nReviews: \nWarning: Spoilers\n\"For the 1968 poll on ICM,I decided that I would watch a number of Italian films from the year. A fan of his since Spasmo introduced me to the Giallo genre,I was thrilled to find one of the two Spaghetti Westerns auteur Umberto Lenzi had made was in 1968,which led to me opening the 100 coffins.\n\nThe plot:\n\nPrepared not to take sides during the Civil War, Jim Slade is sent to jail for two years. Just before he is freed,Slade learns that outlaws have killed his family. Picking up a pistol once out,Slade gets a list of the outlaws who killed his family. Tracking the first ones down easily,Slade discovers that the final outlaw wants to take a town he rules down with him.\n\nView on the film:\nMade just before his Giallo era,director Umberto Lenzi & cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa load up on elements which would dominate Lenzi's unique style,as ultra-stylised whip-pans are shot with a scatter-gun energy by Lenzi,with the camera riding on Slade's bullets of revenge. Toning down his usual liking of violence,Lenzi displays a sharp eye for \"space\",where the lone sound of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's light Jazzy score builds anticipating to Slade's shootout with an outlaw.\n\nInitially looking like an episodic revenge tale, Marco Leto/Eduardo Manzanos Brochero and Vittorio Salerno get Slade to put his revenge Western pistol down by getting him involved in the gritty local politics of the town,which along with giving the flick a neat line in gallows humour,also sets the town up to give Slade and the viewer an excellent twist of the gun. Joined by a stern John Ireland as town leader Douglas, Peter Lee Lawrence (who died of cancer just 30 years old in 1974) gives a wonderful performance as Slade,who masks Slade with an eerie look of false calm,which cracks as Slade opens the hundred coffins.\" \n- Written by morrison-dylan-fan on IMDb.com\n\n\"This western is the type of movie you might see from Something Weird Video or on MST3K. That's not meant to be a put-down (if it was I'd be putting down 2/3 of my movie collection). I really enjoyed this film.\n\nThe movie is directed by Umberto Lenzi, who is better known for his Euro-horror movies. The horror influence is clearly evident here when an escaped band of drooling lunatics runs around grunting and killing everyone in sight. It's a real hoot to see spaghetti western regular Eduardo Fajardo playing the part of a giggling homicidal idiot. This alone makes it worthwhile to seek out this film.\n\nJohn Ireland is great as the gunslinging preacher, and Piero Lulli makes a great villain as usual. The acting from the rest of the cast is not exactly top-notch, but that just adds to the flavor of this film. It's quite funny in parts (perhaps unintentionally but one can never be sure).\n\nThere are also some really funny lines in the movie, which I will not spoil by mentioning here. The way everyone overreacts to the fact that the hero likes to drink water is especially hilarious.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys both spaghetti westerns and strange, funny cult movies.\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

One by one he kills the bandits and learns along the way that a relative of his wife are involved in this crime.\n\nReviews:\n\"Ardisson should have done more spags. He had the look and the chops to pull off the laconic protagonist. This film is a stark reminder of what might have been, as director Musolino passed away at a young age after making only two films (this being the better one). It is well made, with a style that reminds of Leone without completely ripping the master off.\" Written by haskel-72951 on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Standard violent revenge story. Ardisson was always good as an action man in the 60s and early 70s and who doesn't love Sanchez in his usual jovial roles? The use of music from Goldfinger unfortunately took me out of the story when it appeared. There's less female pulchritude than usual for a Euro western. Cristina Iosani's exotic and busty sex appeal, on display in Robert Woods' My Name Is Pecos, is covered up in long dresses here as she plays Ardisson's love interest.

        "Description": "Ben and Charlie - Two likable bandits try to make a living in the Old West.\n\nBen and Charlie (1972)\nDirector: Michele Lupo\nWriters: Sergio Donati, George Eastman\nStars: Giuliano Gemma, George Eastman, Vittorio Congia\nGenre: Comedy, Western\nCountry: Italy, France\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: Amigo, Stay Away\nRelease Date: February 4, 1972 (Italy)\nFilming Location: Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nSynopsis:\nWhen, after serving a three-year sentence, Ben Bellow is released from prison, Charlie Logan is waiting for him. Not to hug him. Not to welcome him. Just to let him know, a bit bluntly for sure, that he does not want to hear from him again. His wish will not be granted as the the two sworn enemies constantly reconnect, rob a bank together and go through a million adventures while hating each other's guts...\n\nReviews:\n\"Giuliano Gemma and George Eastman together? In a buddy picture?! Co-written by Eastman and Sergio Donati?!?! Sign. Me. Up.\n\nGemma (Ben) and Eastman (Charlie) play old associates who can't stand one another. Or, more accurately, Charlie can't stand Ben, to such a degree that he waits three days for Ben to get out of prison just so he can tell him so, and then kick his ass. (Yeah, Charlie protests too much.)\n\nA whole lot of stuff happens — they split up, run into one another, Ben robs a bank and sprints into the street screaming for Charlie, they split up, then run into one another again and lose their clothes, etc, etc, etc — but the real joy in the movie is in simply watching Gemma and Eastman interact. As Ben, Gemma is at his most disarmingly wide-eyed and sincere, all eager affection and cheerful engagement, while Eastman's Charlie is irritable, resentful and, occasionally, violent.\n\nBut Charlie loves Ben in spite of himself, and during the film's third act, when the threats the pair face get serious, Eastman grants Charlie the kind of pathos his characters rarely possess. It's genuinely touching to watch Charlie worry, and to see the two of them try to say goodbye.\n\nI love it with my entire soul. I am so happy.\"\n- written by \"sakana1\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Amico, stammi lontano almeno un palmo\nBelgium Kijk uit Ben, Charlie wil je vel(Flemish)\nBelgium Méfie-toi Ben, Charlie veut ta peau(French)\nBrazil Ben e Charlie\nBulgaria Бен и Чарли(Bulgarian)\nCanada Ben et Charlie(French)\nChile Ben y Charlie\nDenmark Ben og Charlie\nDenmark Pas på - vi slår hårdt(reissue title)\nFinland Ben & Charlie - Lännen villeimät kaverukset\nFinland Hitaat kuolevat nuorena\nFrance Ben et Charlie(DVD Title)\nFrance Méfie-toi Ben, Charlie veut ta peau\nFrance Fais attention Ben, Charlie arrive\nGreece Μπεν και Τσάρλι\nHong Kong Sang lung wut fu daat wong choi(Cantonese)\nHungary Ben és Charlie\nItaly Amico, stammi lontano almeno un palmo\nJapan 新・さすらいの用心棒　ベン＆チャーリー(Japanese)\nNetherlands Ben and Charlie(Alternative Title)\nNorway Vestens lykkejegere\nPortugal Ben e Charlie\nSpain Ben y Charlie(Alternative Title)\nSpain Les llamaban y les llaman dos sinvergüenzas\nSweden Ben och Charlie\nTurkey İki arkadaş(Turkish)\nUnited Kingdom Ben and Charlie\nUnited States Ben and Charlie\nUnited States Amigo, Stay Away(Alternative Title)\nUnited States Humpty Dumpty Gang(Alternative Title)\nWest Germany 2 Himmelhunde im Wilden Westen(video box title)\nWest Germany Ben und Charlie\nWest Germany Zwei linke Hände in der rechten Tasche\nWorld-wide Ben and Charlie(English)\nWorld-wide Ballad of Ben and Charlie(English, Alternative Title)\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

As he recovers from the injuries caused by the attack, Cjamango becomes attached to a Mexican boy, Manuel, and to a beautiful girl, Perla. El Tigre and Pablo are meanwhile at odds with one another about the gold, and Cjamango tries to play them against themselves. But there is also a mysterious stranger whose aims are unclear.\n\nReviews:\n\"Sean Todd (aka Ivan Rassimov) stars in this little known spaghetti western as Cjamango, one of the countless Django-like gunfighters who roamed the Italian west. He's seeking a gold treasure that he won in a poker game which was immediately hijacked by El Tigre and Don Pedro (Pierro Lulli and Lorenzo Livion). Helping him along his way is the mysterious stranger Clint (Mickey Hargitay), an orphan (Giusva), and the beautiful Pearl (Helene Chanel). This one has a higher body count than usual, and among them are some of the good guys. Livion is the guy underneath the pillow in a scene he shares with Lee Van Cleef in that movie, so the film abounds with spaghetti veterans. The music is great, trumpets and guitars, and the final scene is nicely choreographed.

        "Description": "Django the Last Killer - Ramon's parents are killed by men of landowner John Barrett. While trying to get revenge, Ramon is wounded but has saved the life of Rezza, an old disillusioned killer.\n\nDjango the Last Killer (1967)\nDirector: Giuseppe Vari (as Joseph Warren)\nWriter: Augusto Caminito (as Arthur Franck)\nStars: George Eastman, Dragomir Bojanic-Gidra, Dana Ghia\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 10 August 1967 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: The Last Killer\n\nStoryline:\nRamon's parents are killed by men of landowner John Barrett. While trying to get revenge, Ramon is wounded but has saved the life of Rezza, an old disillusioned killer. While nursing his wounds, the men become reluctanfriends and Rezza teaches Ramon the art of shooting, surviving and the loneliness a killer has to bear. Ramon becomes threat for Barrett, the landowner engages Rezza to kill Ramon.\n\nReviews:\n\"Mexican homesteader George Eastman is beaten and robbed on the way to pay off his loan to a local big-wig. Turning down a chance to join a mob against the crooked moneylender, he instead goes and begs for an extension, returning home to find his parents murdered and his farm burned. Before long, he saves the life of a hired killer who teaches him the art of revenge.\n\nA very good low-budget spaghetti western, this benefits from a script that really knows how to push the viewer's emotions, vile heavies, and a couple of decent performances from Eastman and Anthony Ghidra as Django the killer.\n\nThe best thing about this is Ghidra's insights into the world of the gunfighter. His and Eastman's scenes are quite compelling and are alone enough to make the film worth watching.\n\nThere's also a fantastic Ennio Morricone sounding score by Roberto Pregadio.\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com \n\n\"As you probably know, there were a number of spaghetti westerns that capitalized on the success of DJANGO, namely by renaming (during the dubbing) of characters to the name of \"Django\", as they did with this movie. (At least they didn't try to further the ripoff here by having the Django here dress in black and carry a machine gun, as some other films did.)\n\nAnyway, this spaghetti western is not without flaws. It's more leisurely paced than other spaghetti westerns - it takes more than 30 minutes for Eastman's character and \"Django\" to meet, and Eastman's training takes a considerable amount of time. Some viewers may squirm in their seats at some point. His quest for revenge is almost forgotten about along the way. The \"surprise\" twist that happens late in the movie will probably be no surprise to most viewers.\n\nOn the other hand, the production values (sets, photography, etc.) are decent, there is some good and atypical location work (green fields instead of desert), the bad guys are hateful enough, the musical score by Roberto Pregadio is first rate, and there is some interesting dialogue. No, this movie is not a classic of the genre, and certainly won't convert newbies to the genre, but if you like spaghetti westerns like me, it is acceptable.\" Written by Wizard-8 on IMDb.com \n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title) L'ultimo killer\nArgentina El último pistolero\nBrazil (reissue title) Django, o Matador\nBrazil Django, O Último Matador\nBrazil (reissue title) Django, O Último Assassino\nBrazil (reissue title) O Último Matador\nChile Django el último pistolero\nDenmark Django - den sidste dræber\nFrance Le dernier tueur\nGreece (transliterated title) Mexikane, tha pethanis!\nHungary Ramon és a banditák\nPortugal Django - O Último Killer\nSpain El último pistolero del Oeste\nSpain (video title) Último pistolero\nUSA (DVD box title) Django the Last Killer\nWest Germany Rocco - Ich leg' dich um\nWorld-wide (English title) The Last Killer\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) Django poslednji revolveras\nDjango Last Killer\nDjango the Last Gunfighter\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

I recently began collecting any and all spaghetti westerns that I have been able to get my hands on. I had no information on this title, other than knowing Anthony Steffen stars. Now I have seen numerous Steffen Westerns and have not been particularly impressed with his movies nor his acting. But this movie changed my opinion of him DRAMATICALLY! The story centers on 2 Bounty Hunters (Steffen and Mark Damon)that ride into the town of \"Blackstone\" after killing an entire gang of wanted men. Once in town they find themselves in the middle of rash of murders and a corrupt Sheriff who is working for the local \"Rich Man\" who, in turn, is trying to control all the land because the railroad is coming through.\n\nA few plot twists to keep you guessing, and some great acting all the way around provide for an entertaining Spaghetti! This is not your typical \"revenge\" theme Spaghetti Western.\n\nThe chemistry between Steffen and Damon is perfect. I can say with almost certainty that the U.S. television series \"Alias Smith and Jones\" drew heavily from this film! I HIGHLY recommend this film to not only fans of Spaghetti Westerns, but Western fans in general. The plot is cohesive and interesting, the scenes well edited, the cinematography excellent and the gun-play is perfect. No over-acting here except maybe the maniacal laughing at the end by Steffen...although it's not over the top.\n\nA MUST-SEE FOR SPAGHETTI FANS!!!\" Written by rockerace on IMDb.com\n\n\"Anthony Steffen and Mark Damon play two bounty hunters who venture into a town to collect a large unearned bounty, but are instead caught up in a local land war caused by a crooked sheriff and his gang of bandits over the impending arrival of the railroad. Pretty typical spaghetti b western fair, Its not very memorable but also doesn't take itself very seriously despite being quite brutal at times. However its made enjoyable by its quick pace, the presence of genre veterans Steffen and Damon, and some nice direction from Rafael Romero Marchent. Steffen will always be one of my favorites when it comes to the genre.\" Written by b_kite on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA)\n(original title): ¿Quién grita venganza?\nBrazil: Deus Como Pai... e o Diabo como Sócio\nFrance: Les Pistoleros du Nevada\nGreece (transliterated title): Oi nekroi den metriountai\nHong Kong (Cantonese title): Fei foo yau lung chui fai cheung\nItaly: I morti non si contano\nPortugal: Dois homens e Uma Arma\nSpain: ¿Quién grita venganza?\nSweden: Duell i Blackstone Hill\nTurkey (Turkish title): Ölüler Sayılmaz\nUSA: Cry for Revenge\nUSA: Dead Men Don't Count\nWest Germany: An den Galgen, Bastardo\nWorld-wide (English title): Dead Men Don't Count!\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

But I Won't (1968)\nDirector: Vincenzo Musolino (as Glenn Vincent Davis)\nWriter: Vincenzo Musolino (as Glenn Vincent Davis)\nStars: George Ardisson, Dragomir Bojanic-Gidra, Cristina Iosani \nGenres: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 12 August 1968 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Django - Den Colt an der Kehle \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nWhile Cjamango is away from his ranch six bandits attack and kill all the members of his family. Disrupted by this tragedy he sets out to take his revenge. One by one he kills the bandits and learns along the way that a relative of his wife are involved in this crime.\n\nReviews:\n\"Ardisson should have done more spags. He had the look and the chops to pull off the laconic protagonist. This film is a stark reminder of what might have been, as director Musolino passed away at a young age after making only two films (this being the better one). It is well made, with a style that reminds of Leone without completely ripping the master off.\" Written by haskel-72951 on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Standard violent revenge story. Ardisson was always good as an action man in the 60s and early 70s and who doesn't love Sanchez in his usual jovial roles? The use of music from Goldfinger unfortunately took me out of the story when it appeared. There's less female pulchritude than usual for a Euro western. Cristina Iosani's exotic and busty sex appeal, on display in Robert Woods' My Name Is Pecos, is covered up in long dresses here as she plays Ardisson's love interest. The Gatling gun sequence is loud but bloodless, like it is in most westerns and US TV shows with the exception of The Wild Bunch.\" Written by jameselliot-1 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Chiedi perdono a Dio... non a me\nArgentina (poster title): Ruega a Dios antes de morir\nBrazil: Peça Perdão a Deus, Nunca a Mim\nFrance: Chiedi perdono a Dio... non a me\nGreece (transliterated title): Oi xegrammenoi\nNorway: God may forgive you... not me\nPortugal: Pede Perdão a Deus\nUSA: May God Forgive You...

        "Title": "Doc, Hands of Steel | Classic Cowboy Film | Best Western Movie",
        "Description": "Free Cowboy Film: Doc, Hands of Steel - Spaghetti Western - Doc McGregor, former surgeon become player, is wrongly accused of murder and pursued by Slade, a bounty hunter.\n\nDoc, Hands of Steel (1965)\nDirector: Alfonso Balcázar\nWriters: Alfonso Balcázar (screenplay), Alfonso Balcázar (story) \nStars: Carl Möhner, Luis Dávila, Fernando Sancho\nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 January 1967 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: 10.000 dólares vivo o muerto \nFilming Locations: Fraga, Huesca, Aragón, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nDoc McGregor, former surgeon become player, is wrongly accused of murder and pursued by Slade, a bounty hunter. In his escape he finds Larry Kitchener's corpse and decides to impersonate him. But his problems get worse as Kitchener was a famous gunslinger hired as sheriff for the people from Baldosas to stop Reyes, a Mexican bandit who has terrorized them.\n\nReviews:\n\"Romolo (Guerrieri) Girolami - director of classics like Johnny Yuma and 10.000 dollari per un massacro - is listed as assistent-director and one wonders if he was responsible for this more violent ('more italian') nature of the movie.\n\nCarl Möhner is Doc, a former surgeon turned drunkard and gambler with a price on his head. A bounty hunter called Slade is on his trail, but Slade has never seen his face. To confuse Slade, Doc adopts the name of a dead man who went by the name of Kitschner and was known for his golden guns. In a small western town Doc is now taken for a famous gunslinger and offered the job of sheriff. He accepts the offer, mainly because he has an eye on a local beauty, but now the bandits who have killed Kitschner, think the man with the golden gun is still alive ...\n\nA bit slow and predictable at first, the story picks up in the second half with a few plot twists and a flamboyant performance by Fernando Sancho as a sadistic Mexican bandit who enjoys shooting unarmed people, including women and children. The script is a nice variation on the doppelgänger motiv, with Mohner as the man who eventually starts identifying himself with the person whose name and fame he has stolen, becoming a better person in the process: the swindler really becomes the sheriff and the defender of the townspeople and also uses his neglected skills as a surgeon in the film's redemptive finale.\n\nNo less than four people contributed to the script and they all seem to have pushed forward their own ideas. As a result the narrative is meandering, with some story elements developed better than others, but at least the busy plot will have you guessing what will happen next. The movie is by no means great, but it's one of those minor genre entries that are easy to enjoy. The part of the intellectual turned cardsharp turned sheriff suits Möhner well and Davila is solid as the man on his trail who eventually becomes his deputy in the border town. The Italian title, L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro/The man with the golden gun, might have been a reference to Edward Dmytryk's Warlock, an very popular film in Mediterranean countries and released as L'homme aux colts d'or (The Man with the Golden Guns) in France and under similar titles in other countries. Even the idea of the duo of gunslingers coming to a western town to restore law and order might have been taken from Dmytryk's movie.\" Written by Simon Gelten on spaghetti-western.net \n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro\nArgentina: El hombre de la pistola de oro\nBrazil: O Homem da Pistola de Ouro\nCanada (French title): Un colt pour MacGregor\nColombia: El pistolero de oro\nGreece (transliterated title): O anthropos me to hryso pistoli\nJapan (Japanese title): 殺し屋がやって来た\nSpain (working title): 10.000 dólares vivo o muerto\nSpain: Doc, manos de plata\nSweden: Mannen med den gyllene pistolen - Hämnare för dollar\nTurkey (Turkish title): Silah namustur\nUSA: Doc, Hands of Steel\nUSA: The Man Who Came to Kill\nUSA: Man with the Golden Pistol\nUSA (alternative title): The Man with the Golden Gun\nWest Germany (video title): Mad Mexican\nWest Germany: Der Mann, der kam, um zu töten\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "Bastard, Go and Kill | Free Cowboy Film | Spaghetti Western",
        "Description": "Bastard, Go and Kill - Chaco, a Mexican on the run from just about everyone, is framed for the killing of a couple of cattlemen.\n\nBastard, Go and Kill (1971)\nDirector: Gino Mangini (as Luigi Mangini)\nWriters: Sergio Garrone, Gino Mangini (revised screenplay) (as Luigi Mangini)\nStars: George Eastman, Lincoln Tate, Franco Lantieri \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 6 March 1971 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Chaco \n\nStoryline:\nChaco, a Mexican on the run from just about everyone, is framed for the killing of a couple of cattlemen. Everyone knows he's innocent but the evidence is substantial. Chaco escapes and with the help of a bounty hunter, goes after the real murderers.\n\nReviews:\n\"I like my Spaghetti Westerns heavy on the gunplay and loaded with macho posturing. So, after reading the blurb on the back of the recent Wild East Productions release for this film, written by Spaghetti Western expert Tom Betts that makes note of the lack of gunplay, I was not expecting much from this film to be truthful. Within the first five minutes or so we are subjected to attempted vigilante style hanging of the poor half-American- half Mexican Chaco (George Eastman aka Luigi Montefiori) character by a family of Irish brothers who insist that Chaco had raped their poor sister. The noose is placed around the pleading, innocent Chaco's neck and the horse's backside is slapped to send it running, suddenly a gunshot rings out and shoots the rope in two and the horse races off with Chaco very much alive, the shooter being the supposed rape subject, a white woman. \n\n[...]\n\nThe director at times tended to let scenes play out too long and made for some boring, tedious parts, the editing needed to be more focused on the cutting of some scenes, like the celebration in the saloon when Chaco has returned and the festival at the end which is bit laborious to sit through. The cast is uniformly good and the two leads in Eastman and Tate play off each other well as opponents, and create a nice team at the end to exonerate Chaco. The film would probably look back to the film's THE BIG GUN DOWN (1966, Italy), RUN, MAN RUN (1968, Italy, Spain) as its models, the fun loving Mexican who is wrongly accused and it takes an Americano to help free him from prosecution. The film while having an Italian star in George Eastman has no bankable or known American actor in the film, which would point to this film as being produced for the Italian and some third world markets, Tom Betts had this to say about the film's possible distribution \"Yes these films were made for distribution in third world countries and Eastern Europe, Latin America was just starting to shrug off the oppression they felt from the British, America, and the U.S.S.R., Robert Woods told me his Pecos character was almost worshiped as a hero in African countries. They were also shown in the smaller theaters in Italy's small towns where the political content the producer, distributor, writers wanted to get over to the public by disguising it as a western.\"\n\nThe film thoroughly surprised me and was all in all a very enjoyable film presentation.The [Bastardo, vamos a matar|[Chaco]] film is an anamorphic widescreen presentation and includes a picture gallery and an alternative credits sequence. The only issues with the film presented here is that in a few scenes the blacks look a bit chalky, but that does not take anything away from this overall beautiful presentation. The soundtrack sounds great with a few small audio hisses but all in all fantastic. The fact that this hard to find film is available in a region 0 release is enough incentive to purchase, add on the beautiful presentation, and the equally beautiful presentation of THE WILD AND THE DIRTY, and you have a real winner here. This combo of films ranks right at the top in my book of region one spaghetti western releases in 2015. Thank you Wild East for this grand Spaghetti Western release.\" Written by Mike Hauss on spaghetti-western.net\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Pistol for a Hundred Coffins - A Civil War veteran swears revenge when he returns home to find his family killed by a local gang.\n\nPistol for a Hundred Coffins (1968)\nDirector: Umberto Lenzi\nWriters: Marco Leto, Eduardo Manzanos (story) (as Eduardo Manzanos Brochero)\nStars: Peter Lee Lawrence, John Ireland, Gloria Osuna\nCountry: Italy, Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 24 August 1968 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: A Gun for One Hundred Graves \nFilming Locations: Madrid, Spain \n\nStoryline: \nReturning from the civil war Jim Slade discovers his parents dead at their farm. It is said that the gang under the lead of Corbett has committed the crime. Jim now goes for revenge but things turn out to be more complicated than he originally thought. To get some money he accepts the job as a sheriff. Written by cengelm\n\nReviews: \nWarning: Spoilers\n\"For the 1968 poll on ICM,I decided that I would watch a number of Italian films from the year. A fan of his since Spasmo introduced me to the Giallo genre,I was thrilled to find one of the two Spaghetti Westerns auteur Umberto Lenzi had made was in 1968,which led to me opening the 100 coffins.\n\nThe plot:\n\nPrepared not to take sides during the Civil War, Jim Slade is sent to jail for two years. Just before he is freed,Slade learns that outlaws have killed his family. Picking up a pistol once out,Slade gets a list of the outlaws who killed his family. Tracking the first ones down easily,Slade discovers that the final outlaw wants to take a town he rules down with him.\n\nView on the film:\nMade just before his Giallo era,director Umberto Lenzi & cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa load up on elements which would dominate Lenzi's unique style,as ultra-stylised whip-pans are shot with a scatter-gun energy by Lenzi,with the camera riding on Slade's bullets of revenge. Toning down his usual liking of violence,Lenzi displays a sharp eye for \"space\",where the lone sound of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's light Jazzy score builds anticipating to Slade's shootout with an outlaw.\n\nInitially looking like an episodic revenge tale, Marco Leto/Eduardo Manzanos Brochero and Vittorio Salerno get Slade to put his revenge Western pistol down by getting him involved in the gritty local politics of the town,which along with giving the flick a neat line in gallows humour,also sets the town up to give Slade and the viewer an excellent twist of the gun. Joined by a stern John Ireland as town leader Douglas, Peter Lee Lawrence (who died of cancer just 30 years old in 1974) gives a wonderful performance as Slade,who masks Slade with an eerie look of false calm,which cracks as Slade opens the hundred coffins.\" \n- Written by morrison-dylan-fan on IMDb.com\n\n\"This western is the type of movie you might see from Something Weird Video or on MST3K. That's not meant to be a put-down (if it was I'd be putting down 2/3 of my movie collection). I really enjoyed this film.\n\nThe movie is directed by Umberto Lenzi, who is better known for his Euro-horror movies. The horror influence is clearly evident here when an escaped band of drooling lunatics runs around grunting and killing everyone in sight. It's a real hoot to see spaghetti western regular Eduardo Fajardo playing the part of a giggling homicidal idiot. This alone makes it worthwhile to seek out this film.\n\nJohn Ireland is great as the gunslinging preacher, and Piero Lulli makes a great villain as usual. The acting from the rest of the cast is not exactly top-notch, but that just adds to the flavor of this film. It's quite funny in parts (perhaps unintentionally but one can never be sure).\n\nThere are also some really funny lines in the movie, which I will not spoil by mentioning here. The way everyone overreacts to the fact that the hero likes to drink water is especially hilarious.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys both spaghetti westerns and strange, funny cult movies.\" Written by spider89119 on IMDb.com\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Long Days of Hate - A bounty, Benson is hunting down a vicious outlaw gang, who killed his parents, brother and sisters, except for one sister, Susy, who he wants for himself! \n\nLong Days of Hate (1968)\nDirector: Gianfranco Baldanello\nWriters: Luigi Emmanuele (story), Luigi Emmanuele (screenplay) \nStars: Guy Madison, Lucienne Bridou, Rik Battaglia \nGenres: Crime | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 20 July 1973 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: This Man Can't Die \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nIn 1870 Texas, a gang of gun smugglers supplies arms, ammunition and whiskey to Indians. Undercover government agent Martin Benson helps the army eliminate such smugglers. However, the army still needs to know the identity of the man in charge of the gang and the location of their latest hideout. Martin Benson wants to retire but the army asks him to find the head of the smugglers. The army arguments that Benson is the best agent for the job even if another undercover agent, Tony Guy, has already penetrated the smugglers' outfit. A huge payment in gold coins is also offered to Benson as an enticement. Benson agrees to this last assignment and heads out of the army fort. On the trail, many gun runners and bandits try to ambush him and have him killed. In the nearest town, at the Benson farm, a group of smugglers raid and ransack the farm and kill Martin Benson's parents. They also rape his sister, Jenny. The other Benson siblings, Arias, Susy and Daniel are in town buying supplies. \n\nReviews:\n\"\"I lunghi giorni dell'odio\" (litrall translation: \"Long Days of Hate\") AKA \"This Man Can't Die\" (1967), directed by the capable Gianfranco Baldanello, who would go on to make the infamous \"Black Jack\" (1968), is above average Spaghetti Western. While not on the same level as Leone, Corbucci or Castellari, this film still holds it's grip pretty well, with excellent action scenes, some well staged bar brawls, very well done shootouts and a neat, Leonesque showdown for the climax. The plot is the usual story: parents murdered and daughter raped by outlaws, the sons set out to avenge their deaths. But it's capably handled, even if the revealing of who the head of the outlaws is is no big surprise. Still, a must-see for fans of the Spaghetti Western genre.\" Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com\n\n\"Released in 1968 and directed by Gianfranco Baldanello, \"This Man Can't Die\" (aka \"The Long Days of Hate\") stars Guy Madison as a government-hired agent looking for the ringleader of a group of gunrunner/bootleggers. Meanwhile his parents are murdered and youngest sister raped (Anna Liotti). Will he and his younger brother & other sister (Steve Merrick & Susy Benson) find the killers and their ringleader? Rik Battaglia and Rosalba Neri are also on hand.\n\nThis is a serious spaghetti Western more akin to Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) than his comic booky (and sometimes goofy) Man with No Name trilogy. But it's half as long as \"Once Upon a Time\" and therefore leaner, which is better in my book (although \"Once Upon a Time\" is technically the better movie). While not great, it's a solid Western with a lousy English-speaking title. Too bad Anna Liotti's role wasn't bigger because she's an ultra-cutie.\" Written by Wuchakk on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): I lunghi giorni dell'odio\nArgentina: Este hombre no puede morir\nBelgium (French title): Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nBelgium (Flemish title): Deze man mag niet sterven\nBrazil: Este Homem Não Deve Morrer\nCanada (English title): This Man Can't Die\nDenmark: Den mand må ikke dø\nFinland: Tämä mies ei kuole\nFrance: Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nGreece (transliterated title): Kremaste ta katharmata\nGreece (video title): Agria ekdikisi\nNorway: This Man Can't Die\nPortugal: O Longo Dia do Ódio\nRomania: Acest om nu trebuie să moară\nSweden: Uppgörelsen\nUSA: Long Days of Hate\nWest Germany: Seine Winchester pfeift das Lied vom Tod\n This Man Can't Die\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Jeff applies for the job of deputy sheriff in a border town, so he can shoot the Mexicans legally when they cross the border. But there are a few complications: The Mexicans have an accomplice in town, a criminal mastermind who’s the architect of all their activities. He is known by the name of Saguaro (which is also the alternative title of the movie) but nobody has ever seen his face ...\n\nAccording to Marco Giusti this movie is a remake, in western form, of a peplum movie called Sansone contro i pirati, also starring Morris and also directed by Boccia (*1). Sansone is Samson in Italian, but apparently the film was not set in Biblical times, but in the Carribean, anno 1630. In this remake the Carribean has become the American-Mexican border and the pirates have become bandidos launching their attacks on horseback. Some Cucaracha-kind-of-music is played every time they ride out and when they’re spotted in the distance, women and children quickly seek shelter, crying: The Mexicans are coming! The Mexicans are coming! I wouldn't like to accuse Boccia of racial prejudice, but subtle it ain’t. Anyway, what might have worked in a pirate movie (\"The pirates are coming!\" seems a logical reaction when the black flag is spotted in the distance) doesn’t work here.\n\nChunky muscle man Morris looks like a younger, more muscular version of Hoss Cartwright. The film has a bit of everything: fistfights, romance, murder, mayhem, even an under water scene (no doubt a relic of the pirate days of the movie). On the plus side we get a brief but tickling flagellation scene involging a señorita with a well-shaped back. Gordon Mitchell has an entertaining cameo as a black-clad cardsharp with bleached hair, but I had no idea what he was doing in the movie, apart from being shot and blowing up a few opponents with dynamite.\n\nForgettable stuff, for completists only.\" Written by Scherpschutter on spaghetti-western.net\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Sapevano solo uccidere\nBrazil: Somente Sabia Matar\nFrance: Seul contre les mercenaires\nGreece (transliterated title): Ixeran mono na skotonoun\nUSA (complete title): I'll Die for Vengeance\nWest Germany: Mein Leben für die Rache\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Her uncle started the saloon, but was killed the day she arrived in town by town boss Tucan (Luis Induni) and his henchmen. The saloon sits on what Tucan believes is an underground treasure of silver. So he wants her saloon and the land on which it’s located. Reopening the saloon stirs up a new round of hostilities that includes an attack on the Donovan ranch and that convinces Djurado everyone might be better off if he left town. But Tucan still has a grudge against the young men. Djurado is tracked down and beaten. And while he recovers from his wounds, Tucan has his men rob a bank and leave behind a clue that points to Djurado as the guilty party. Now he has no choice but to return to Silver Mine to try to clear his name and end Tucan’s reign of tyranny.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Djurado\nBrazil: Djurado\nGreece (transliterated title): Viva caballeros\nSpain: Jim Golden Poker\n Johnny Golden Poker\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "The Great Treasure Hunt | Best Western Movie",
        "Description": "The Great Treasure Hunt - Spaghetti Western - A blind man wants to get his mitts on a crooks' gold. He can't do it alone, so he hires the quartet of soldiers-of-fortune to help him. \n\nThe Great Treasure Hunt (1972)\nDirector: Tonino Ricci\nWriters: Fabrizio Diotallevi (screenplay) (as Fabio Tallevi), Jesús R. Folgar (story)\nStars: Mark Damon, Rosalba Neri, Stelvio Rosi \nGenres: Action | Comedy | Thriller | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 7 February 1972 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: 5 pour l'or de los quadros \nFilming Locations: Estudios Cinematografica Roma S.A., Madrid, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nAfter committing a robbery, Sam is about to be hanged. His brother Dean contacts a Frenchman (former expert in explosives) and his attractive niece (a poker player). The three put on a scheme to make a bank robbery, just in time to disrupt Sam's hanging, and free him, too. In turn, the four are hired by Felipe, a blind Mexican interested in art painting, namely some paintings that are kept by the military dictator, El Supremo. The task would be difficult already, but it's worth as the two brothers weren't fighting each other for whatever reason, and if everybody had not ulterior motives for their acts.\n\nReviews:\n\"My review is of the English-dubbed, fullscreen VHS video, released in the US in the 1980s, entitled THE GREAT TREASURE HUNT. Lovable rogue Dean Madison (played by the charming Mark Damon, always good as a lovable rogue!) enlists a French munitions expert and his \"niece\" (played by the luscious Rosalba Neri--she and Damon would be reunited the next year in DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT) to help save his brother Sam, who has just been caught while robbing a bank. After that incident is resolved, about one-third of the way into the film, a blind man named Felipe is waiting for the quartet, and explains that he was kept prisoner and tortured by a mad Mexican general who has appointed himself as \"El Supremo\" and has built an impregnable fortress which is filled with gold. He suggests the quartet work with him to get that gold, so they head toward Mexico and thus begins the Great Treasure Hunt of the title. This is not a nihilistic, bleak Italian western--it's an entertaining caper film (really not unlike OCEAN'S ELEVEN or GRAND SLAM, but in western garb), nicely shot (except for too many unconvincing day-for-night shots), and well-acted by all the principals, especially Damon and Neri. Most of the music sounds unlike typical Italian western music (except in a few scenes), sounding more like a typical USA adventure film score. There's nothing profound or incredibly original here (although the surprise ending comes off well!), but it's an entertaining Eurowestern adventure, and those who must see as many Eurowesterns as they can will want to track down this one. As it was released on video in the USA, used rental copies can probably be found. A pleasant surprise! Damon appeared in many other excellent Eurowesterns, and of course went on to great success as a producer and film executive, capacities in which he still works as of this writing (check his producer filmography to see the many hits he's been involved with!). However, he's still a star as an actor in my house, and much of his European output is still in need of rediscovery. I hope to find more in the coming years...\" Written by django-1 on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Monta in sella!!

        "Description": "Long Days of Hate - A bounty, Benson is hunting down a vicious outlaw gang, who killed his parents, brother and sisters, except for one sister, Susy, who he wants for himself! \n\nLong Days of Hate (1968)\nDirector: Gianfranco Baldanello\nWriters: Luigi Emmanuele (story), Luigi Emmanuele (screenplay) \nStars: Guy Madison, Lucienne Bridou, Rik Battaglia \nGenres: Crime | Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 20 July 1973 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: This Man Can't Die \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nIn 1870 Texas, a gang of gun smugglers supplies arms, ammunition and whiskey to Indians. Undercover government agent Martin Benson helps the army eliminate such smugglers. However, the army still needs to know the identity of the man in charge of the gang and the location of their latest hideout. Martin Benson wants to retire but the army asks him to find the head of the smugglers. The army arguments that Benson is the best agent for the job even if another undercover agent, Tony Guy, has already penetrated the smugglers' outfit. A huge payment in gold coins is also offered to Benson as an enticement. Benson agrees to this last assignment and heads out of the army fort. On the trail, many gun runners and bandits try to ambush him and have him killed. In the nearest town, at the Benson farm, a group of smugglers raid and ransack the farm and kill Martin Benson's parents. They also rape his sister, Jenny. The other Benson siblings, Arias, Susy and Daniel are in town buying supplies. \n\nReviews:\n\"\"I lunghi giorni dell'odio\" (litrall translation: \"Long Days of Hate\") AKA \"This Man Can't Die\" (1967), directed by the capable Gianfranco Baldanello, who would go on to make the infamous \"Black Jack\" (1968), is above average Spaghetti Western. While not on the same level as Leone, Corbucci or Castellari, this film still holds it's grip pretty well, with excellent action scenes, some well staged bar brawls, very well done shootouts and a neat, Leonesque showdown for the climax. The plot is the usual story: parents murdered and daughter raped by outlaws, the sons set out to avenge their deaths. But it's capably handled, even if the revealing of who the head of the outlaws is is no big surprise. Still, a must-see for fans of the Spaghetti Western genre.\" Written by JohnWelles on IMDb.com\n\n\"Released in 1968 and directed by Gianfranco Baldanello, \"This Man Can't Die\" (aka \"The Long Days of Hate\") stars Guy Madison as a government-hired agent looking for the ringleader of a group of gunrunner/bootleggers. Meanwhile his parents are murdered and youngest sister raped (Anna Liotti). Will he and his younger brother & other sister (Steve Merrick & Susy Benson) find the killers and their ringleader? Rik Battaglia and Rosalba Neri are also on hand.\n\nThis is a serious spaghetti Western more akin to Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) than his comic booky (and sometimes goofy) Man with No Name trilogy. But it's half as long as \"Once Upon a Time\" and therefore leaner, which is better in my book (although \"Once Upon a Time\" is technically the better movie). While not great, it's a solid Western with a lousy English-speaking title. Too bad Anna Liotti's role wasn't bigger because she's an ultra-cutie.\" Written by Wuchakk on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): I lunghi giorni dell'odio\nArgentina: Este hombre no puede morir\nBelgium (French title): Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nBelgium (Flemish title): Deze man mag niet sterven\nBrazil: Este Homem Não Deve Morrer\nCanada (English title): This Man Can't Die\nDenmark: Den mand må ikke dø\nFinland: Tämä mies ei kuole\nFrance: Ringo ne devait pas mourir\nGreece (transliterated title): Kremaste ta katharmata\nGreece (video title): Agria ekdikisi\nNorway: This Man Can't Die\nPortugal: O Longo Dia do Ódio\nRomania: Acest om nu trebuie să moară\nSweden: Uppgörelsen\nUSA: Long Days of Hate\nWest Germany: Seine Winchester pfeift das Lied vom Tod\n This Man Can't Die\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Sartana Will Pay - When a young woman inherits a goldmine from her murdered uncle, Sartana comes to her aid as various swindlers, including the local sheriff, try to claim it as their own.\n\nHave a Good Funeral, My Friend... Sartana Will Pay (1970)\nDirector: Giuliano Carnimeo\nWriters: Giovanni Simonelli, Roberto Gianviti\nStars: Gianni Garko, Antonio Vilar, Daniela Giordano\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy, Spain\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: A Coffin from Sartana\nRelease Date: October 8, 1970 (Italy)\nFilming Location: Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nSynopsis:\nAfter witnessing a brutal massacre, the legendary hero Sartana is ready to do some investigating. Almost everyone in the tiny town of Indian Creek seems eager to buy up the property left behind by the murder victims, and one of them could well be behind the killings. The sheriff himself is not above suspicion, so Sartana must uncover the culprit all on his own.\n\nReviews:\n\"Garko and Carnimeo cooperated in some good Italo-Westerns in the late 60s/early 70s, most remarkable is the \"Sartana\"-Series. This is definitely one of the best Sartana-Movies; tough, cynical and with a lot of humor, seasoned with all herbs of an excellent italo-western. The plot has some twists, good shoot-outs and a decent body count. The soundtrack's fine, good work done by Bruno Nicolai. The cast is standard with lot's of Italian b-movie heroes (ruffini, dell' acqua...) I had a lot of fun with this movie and it's worth watching it more than one time.

        "Description": "Buckaroo: The Winchester Does Not Forgive - When the stagecoach in which they travel is attacked by Monteiro's gang, Lash accepts to kill his friend to save his bacon. \n\nBuckaroo: The Winchester Does Not Forgive (1967)\nDirector: Adelchi Bianchi\nWriters: Antonio Romano, Romano Scucciuglia (screenplay) \nStars: Dean Reed, Monika Brugger, Livio Lorenzon \nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 3 October 1969 (West Germany)\nAlso Known As: Buccaroo - El Winchester que no perdona \n\nStoryline: \nWhen the stagecoach in which they travel is attacked by Monteiro's gang, Lash accepts to kill his friend to save his bacon. On reaching his destination - a village near the Mexican border where he is to take possession of a gold mine, he realizes that he has a neighbor, old Johnny, who owns a farm and another gold mine. He immediately sets about making his life miserable, hoping to drive him from the country and lay hands on his possessions. Lash soon becomes the undisputed master of the area, at least until Buckaroo, a wild horse tamer, arrives in town.The young man accepts to work for Johnny and, when his boss is killed in an ambush, starts gathering men with a view to fighting back Lash's army, reinforced by Monteiro and his men, who have resurfaced. After many adventures, Buckaroo gets rid of both Monteiro and Lash, in whom he has recognized the cowardly murderer of his own father.\n\nReviews:\n\"The mysterious stranger Buccaroo (Dean Reed) rides into the small gold-digger's nest New Tuscosa, only to discover that the town is dominated by the multiple mine owner Lash (great Livio Lorenzon). As you know from countless westerns, he has gotten the biggest part of his property by forcing the former mine owners into a cheap sale. The only opponent of Lash is the aging gold digger Johnny McKenzie (Ugo Sasso), who strictly refuses to give away his mine under price. But all by himself he is practically in a lost position. Help comes his way in the person of Buccaroo, who condemns Lash's bad methods and dares to stand up against his ruthless thugs. He gets support by Jean Louis, among others, who you probably know best from Barboni's Four Fists for a Hallelujah. Will they be able to withstand the pressure of the villian and what secret does Buccaroo carry inside? With Dino Strano and Gilberto Galimberti there are other well-known faces of the genre in smaller supporting roles, while Monika Brugger (Annie) and Angela De Leo provide the female charms of the film.\n\nAdelchi Bianchi's (not to be confused with Andrea Bianchi) Buckaroo - Il winchester che non perdona is solid Italo-Western material and knows how to entertain, although something more could have been made of the story. Dean Read plays his role as usual with his tongue in his cheeks and even gets to smash a few (terribly inappropriate) songs (among others \"For tomorrow I may die\"). Livio Lorenzon once again convinces as a nasty villain and the rest of the line-up does a good job, too. The musical background of Lallo Gori is fine, although I think I know some of the songs from various Fidani epics. All in all, Buccaroo - Gallows Birds doesn't offer any decent entertainment, yet without standing out from the broad, at best elevated, midfield of the genre.\n\nThe movie is rather mediocre, but can entertain adequately, has been well directed and the actors also know how to convince. Fans and collectors should strike, as this is an absolute rarity, which is now available on DVD for the first time worldwide!\" Written by BluntWolf on letterboxd.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Buckaroo (Il winchester che non perdona)\nBrazil: Buckaroo, a Winchester que não Perdoa\nFrance: Buckaroo ne pardonne pas\nGreece (transliterated title): Enas pistoli keravnos\nSpain: Buccaroo - El Winchester que no perdona\nUSA: Buckaroo: The Winchester Does Not Forgive\nWest Germany: Buccaroo - Galgenvögel zwitschern nicht\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "The White, the Yellow, and the Black - In the 19th century, when the Japanese Emperor sends a gift pony to the US President it gets stolen and ransomed by Indians but Sheriff Gideon aided by an inept Japanese servant offers to deliver the ransom.\n\nThe White, the Yellow, and the Black (1975)\nDirector: Sergio Corbucci\nWriters: Antonio Troiso, Marcello Coscia, Sergio Spina\nStars: Giuliano Gemma, Tomas Milian, Eli Wallach\nGenre: Western, Adventure, Comedy\nCountry: Italy, Spain, France\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: Samurai\nRelease Date: January 17, 1975 (Italy)\nFilming Location: Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nSynopsis:\nIn the 19th century, a Japanese delegation arrives in the USA to present the American president with a gift pony from the Japanese Emperor.The Japanese consider the pony to be divine and it is guarded by Japanese Samurai.A tribe of renegade Indians attack the train and steal the pony with the intention of ransoming it.In order to retrieve the pony, the Japanese delegation offers one million dollars in ransom money, to be delivered to the Indians by the local Sheriff Gideon assisted by the inept Japanese servant Sakura, who believes he is a true Samurai.On the way, the duo runs into the drifter Blanc De Blanc, who is Swiss and has plans of his own concerning the ransom money.\n\nReviews:\n\"For more than three decades western movies ruled supreme but during the mid 70’s the genre was blowing out its last fart. Sergio Corbucci successfully directed, for a decade long, westerns and The White, The Yellow and The Black is his last western, a parody on the genre. After this until his death in 1990, Corbucci made nothing but comedies. With the Bud Spencer/Terence Hill ones being the most famous. WYB was part of Corbucci’s western comedies wich all bombed. This third one a stars Eli Wallach and my favorite Italian actor Tomas Milian. Milian portrays a Japanese samurai, a shameless and grotesque stereotype of a performance. It is so over the top you have to laugh with it. Grunting, making stupid noises all the time and using a gibberish Japanese language. His performance is more based on kungfu comedies and the way he looks is completely ridiculous. The plot is another kind of dumb. A pony that gets worshipped by the Japanese gets kidnapped and ransom is asked. It is up to Eli Wallach playing a Sheriff to get the pony out and paying the ransom money. On the way he meets a known outlaw and a samurai. I quite liked this dumb shit as many of the western tropes are parodied with amusing results. The soundtrack is also a great joy.\"\n- written by \"Rob Croonenborghs\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Il bianco il giallo il nero\nBrazil O Último Samurai do Oeste\nBrazil Três Homens, Uma Lei(reissue title)\nBulgaria Белия, жълтия и черния(Bulgarian)\nCanada Samurai(English, Video Title)\nCanada The White, the Yellow, and the Black(English)\nFinland Valkoinen, keltainen ja nero\nFrance Le Blanc, le Jaune et le Noir\nGreece 3 δυναμίτες του Ουέστ(reissue title)\nGreece Ο άσπρος, ο μαύρος και ο κίτρινος\nGreece Ο καλός, ο κακός και ο κίτρινος(Video Title)\nHungary A Fehér, a Sárga és a Fekete(Alternative Title)\nHungary Vadnyugati szamuráj\nItaly Il bianco il giallo il nero\nJapan ザ・サムライ　荒野の珍道中(Japanese)\nLithuania Baltas, geltonas ir juodas\nPortugal Dispara Primeiro...

        "Description": "More Dollars for the MacGregors - Spaghetti Western - Forsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger\n\nMore Dollars for the MacGregors (1970)\nDirector: José Luis Merino\nWriters: Arrigo Colombo, Enrico Colombo \nStars: Peter Lee Lawrence, Carlos Quiney, Malisa Longo \nGenres: Drama | Western \nCountry: Italy | Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 27 September 1970 (Italy) \nAlso Known As: Death Seeks a Man \nFilming Locations: Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nForsythe, who uses his wife as bait, has gained a reputation as a gunslinger. When the game backfires, and she is killed, he sets out in pursuit, but a mysterious rider joins the chase. \n\nReviews:\n\"George Forsyte (Carlos Quiney) is a notorious bounty killer who is doing his best to earn a grand total of half a million dollars before retiring.  He specialises in setting traps for his victims, drawing them in by using his wife Gladys (María Mahor) as bait, pretending that she’s an innocent on the road carrying plenty of easily purloinable cash; and when he catches them, he shows no mercy, killing them with his trademark technique of a bullet in the forehead.  Things go badly wrong, however, when he tries to bring in vicious killer Joe Saxon (Vidal Molina).  Distracted momentarily by a poisonous snake, he allows Saxon to escape and Gladys is murdered as a result.  Naturally enough, he wants to have revenge, but this doesn’t work out either: before he can get to him Saxon is killed – and the reward on his head is collected – by another bounty hunter called Robert MacGregor (Peter Lee Lawrence).\n\nWhile Forsyte spends time licking his wounds, MacGregor sets off to capture another villain, Ross Steward (Stan Cooper).  Steward and his men are hiding out in the hills, where they’re forcing the local Indians to mine salt, but MacGregor’s initial efforts to locate him result in him being badly beaten and left for dead.  Nursed back to health by tasty squaw Yuma (Malisa Longo), he finds his work has become further complicated by the reappearance of Forsyte, whose motivations have become even less clear following his wife’s death.\n\nIn fact, for the first forty minutes or so it all works very well, but then it shifts focus with the death of Joe Saxon at about the forty minute mark.  At this point Forsyte fades rather into the background – until the final stages of the film at least – and the less defined Macgregor, who had hardly featured previously, takes centre stage.  Several new characters are also introduced, including the erratic Steward and the Indians (who look like nothing so much as escapees from a hippie festival), which acts to defuse the mood and ambience which had developed so nicely. In effect it plays like two parts of a TV series joined together into a feature length production, which raises the question as to whether this was intentional or whether one of the stars was perhaps unavailable for some of the filming and the script had to be adapted at the last moment.

Roy is hungry for Alicia, for money and for revenge. Alicia convinces Roy and Montero to join forces and follow her into Mexico where a Revolutionary leader is offering one million dollars to any mercenary who can destroy a federal Mexican Army arsenal. Of course, Roy and Montero agree with Alicia's plan. They all head to Mexico, willing to risk their lives for one million dollars. Once arrived at their destination, the unlikely partners find that the Revolutionary leader is a bit loco and the task more difficult than imagined. The million dollar reward is real alright but crosses and double-crosses ensue.\n\nReviews:\nThis spaghetti western, is a comedy, with the background of the standard tortilla western: revolutionaries, federals, bank robbers and rich people hungry for money too? The modus operandi of many of the characters is greed.\n\nThe comedy scenes between Gina Lollobrigida and her suitors, there are several, including one with Lee Van Cleef and the other James Mason. She is the main sexual magnet of the film, and play to always act for her benefit, to survive and finance her lifestyle. And the male characters are not fooled.\n\nLee Van Cleef works well in a comic register, as a gang leader, not mastering everything, selling his gang for money, but very rarely getting paid.\n\nThis spaghetti western stands out thanks to its romantic comedy humor in the middle of the tortilla western. What's more, supported by a great cast. It should be noted that, like all tortilla westerns, it contains its share of successful and spectacular gunfights, explosions and attacks, which are well integrated into the plot.\n- written by \"norbert-plan-618-715813\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) El hombre de Río Malo\nArgentina Los hombres malos del río\nAustralia Badman's River\nBrazil A Quadrilha da Fronteira\nBrazil Duelo de Bravos(cable TV title)\nBrazil Duelo dos Homens Maus(Video Title)\nBulgaria Реката на бандита(Bulgarian)\nCanada Bad Man's River(English)\nChile El río de los malditos\nDenmark Vestens kanoner\nFinland Bad Roy King(Video Title)\nFinland Tappotuulella\nFinland Skjut för att döda(Swedish, Alternative Title)\nFrance Les quatre mercenaires d'El Paso\nGreece King, o tromeros(transliterated title)\nHungary Rossz emberek folyója\nIreland Bad Man's River(English)\nItaly ...E continuavano a fregarsi il milione di dollari\nLithuania Blogo žmogaus upe\nNorway Kjeltringenes paradis\nPoland Rzeka złoczyńców\nPortugal Vamos Ter Sarilho\nRomania Hoţii din El Paso\nRomania Omul din Río Malo(Alternative Title)\nRomania Râul omului rău(Alternative Title)\nSerbia Reka zlog čoveka\nSlovenia Zlega moža reka\nSoviet Union Река плохого человека(Russian)\nSpain El hombre de Río Malo\nSpain Y Seguian Robandose el Milion di Dolares(Alternative Title)\nSweden Bad Man's River\nSweden Bad Roy King(Video Title)\nTurkey Vurguncular Kraliçesi(Turkish)\nUnited Kingdom Bad Man's River\nUnited States Bad Man's River\nUnited States Hunt the Man Down\nWest Germany Bad Man's River(Video Title)\nWest Germany Matalo\nYugoslavia Reka zlog čoveka(Serbian)\nYugoslavia Zlega moža reka(Slovenian)\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "$1,000 on the Black - Twelve years ago, Sartana framed his brother Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend. Now the town's undisputed boss and doted over by his possessive mother, Sartana seems safe - until, his sentence served, Johnny rides back into town.\n\n$1,000 on the Black (1966)\nDirector: Alberto Cardone\nWriters: Ernesto Gastaldi (story), Vittorio Salerno (story), Rolf Olsen\nStars: Anthony Steffen, Gianni Garko, Erika Blanc\nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy, West Germany\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: Blood at Sundown\nRelease Date: 18 December 1966 (Italy)\nFilming Location: Elios Film, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nReviews:\n\"Decent and morally upright Johnny Liston (an excellent and sympathetic performance by Anthony Steffen) gets out of jail after serving twelve years. He vows to get revenge on his evil and ruthless despot brother Sartana (robustly played with deliciously vicious aplomb by Gianni Garko), who framed Johnny for murder and stole his girlfriend Manuela Holt (lovely Angelica Ott). \nDirector Alberto Cardone, working from a dark and uncompromising script by Ernesto Gestaldi and Rolf Olsen, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, does an expert job of creating and sustaining an extremely tough and gritty tone, milks the potent sibling rivalry theme for all it's worth, and stages the rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs and stirring shoot-outs with considerable gusto. Steffen and Garko do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive able support from Erika Blanc as the fiery Joselita, Robert Miali as hapless browbeaten mute Jerry, Carla Calo as the bitter, boozy Rhonda Liston, Franco Fantasia as the weak, ineffectual sheriff, Sieghardt Rupp as the nasty Ralph, and Carlo D'Angelo as the crooked, slippery Judge Waldorf. Gino Santini's sumptuous cinematography offers plenty of bold and startling compositions (the sweeping panoramic shots of the dusty and desolate desert are especially striking and impressive). Michele Lacerenza's twangy and harmonic score likewise hits the flavorsome spot. \nBut it's the film's remarkably hard and harsh no-nonsense mood which in turn gives this movie an extra jolting edge: the villains are truly hateful and sadistic, the outbursts of violence are quite savage and shocking (even women and children aren't spared from the copious brutality), and the climactic bloodbath is both wild and exciting. Well worth seeing.\"\n- written by \"Woodyanders\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) 1000 dollari sul nero\nArgentina El látigo del Diablo\nBrazil Johnny Texas\nCanada Les colts de la violence(French)\nFrance Les colts de la violence\nGreece Aima ston ilio(Video Title)\nGreece Oi epikirygmenoi(transliterated title)\nHungary Ezer dollárt a feketére(TV Title)\nItaly 1000 dollari sul nero\nItaly Sartana: Sangue e la penna(reissue title)\nJapan 砂塵に血を吐け(Japanese)\nNetherlands Duel Bij Zonsondergang(informal literal title)\nPortugal Mil dolares no preto\nSpain 1000 dólares al negro(Alternative Title)\nSpain Baño de sangre al salir del sol\nSweden Blod i sol - 1.000 svarta dollar\nTurkey Altın Sarı Kan Kırmızı(Turkish, Alternative Title)\nTurkey Siyah'a 1000 Dolar(Turkish)\nUnited Kingdom Blood at Sundown\nUnited Kingdom 1000 dollari sul nero (subtitle $1000 On Black)(TV Title)\nUnited States Blood at Sundown\nUnited States $1,000 on the Black\nUnited States One Thousand Dollars on the Black\nWest Germany Sartana\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Run, Man, Run - Spaghetti Western - Several competing groups and mavericks (including the lead character Cuchillo) are hunting a gold treasure of $3,000,000.\n\nRun, Man, Run (1968)\nDirector: Sergio Sollima\nWriters: Sergio Sollima (story), Sergio Sollima (screenplay)\nStars: Tomas Milian, Donald O'Brien, Linda Veras \nGenres: Adventure | Comedy | Western \nCountry: Italy | France\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 September 1969 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: Big Gundown 2: Run, Man, Run \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain \n\nStoryline:\nSeveral competing groups and mavericks (including the lead character Cuchillo) are hunting a gold treasure of $3,000,000. The gold was reserved for the Mexican revolution.\n\nReviews:\n\"Once upon a time in the cinematic west, more particularly during the sixties, you had to be Italian and your first name preferably had to be Sergio in order to make the greatest Spaghetti Westerns of all time. There was the greatest Sergio of them all (Sergio Leone, creator of the \"Dollars\"-trilogy and \"Once upon a time in the West\") but there was also Sergio Corbucci who made the awesomely terrific \"Django\" and \"The Great Silence\", and last but not least there was Sergio Sollima who was responsible for \"The Big Gundown\" and its mega-cool sequel \"Run Man Run\". Unfortunately I haven't seen the original yet    it's hardly my fault Blue Underground opted to include only the sequel in the fabulous Spaghetti Western Collection DVD box    but the follow up is a vastly entertaining, fast-paced, refreshing, exhilarating and effectively light-headed western adventures and promptly became one of my new personal favorites in the genre. Tomas Milian is stupendous as usual depicting the witty and hyperactive petty criminal Manuel \"Cuchillo\" Sanchez who is literally always on the run; whether for his demanding fiancée who insists on getting married or    due to a series of unforeseen events    from a whole lot of bounty hunters, organized criminal gangs and Mexican army officers. After helping a Mexican revolutionist to escape from jail, Cuchillo receives some valuable information regarding the whereabouts of a treasure of $3.000.000 in gold. This money is meant to finance the Mexican Revolution, but obviously several parties are more than interested in stealing it and they're all short on Cuchillo's tail as he's the only one who can lead them to the exact location. This top-class Italian western is near damn perfect from every viewpoint. The typical \"Viva La Revolution\" theme is always present, but never obtrusively shoved down your throat like often the case in other westerns (for example \"Bullet for the General\") and actually the emphasis strangely enough lies on comedy and abrupt plot twists instead of on harsh fights until death. Cuchillo spends most of his time on screen either running (duh!) or captured by one of his many opponents and subjected to ingenious methods of torture, but his narrow escapes are even greater to behold. Despite the comical atmosphere, \"Run Man Man\" nevertheless contains large portions of violence (Cuchillo is an expert knife thrower) and typically wild Western shootouts in desolate areas. The musical scores, courtesy of both Bruno Nicolai and Ennio Morricone, are beyond genius. The title track can be found on YouTube and I'm really addicted to it.\" Written by Coventry on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Corri uomo corri\nAlbania: Vrapo or mik, vrapo\nBrazil: Corre Homem, Corre\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Бягай, човече, бягай\nDenmark: Flygt mand - flygt\nFinland: Ratsasta henkesi edestä\nFrance: Saludos, hombre\nGreece (transliterated title): Prohora, katharma, prohora\nHungary (TV title): Fuss, ember, fuss!\nJapan (Japanese title): 続・復讐のガンマン　走れ、男、走れ\nNorway: Mannen med kasteknivene\nPortugal: Corre Homem Corre\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Беги, человек, беги\nSpain: ¡Corre, Cuchillo... corre!\nSweden: Mannen med kastknivarna\nTurkey (Turkish title): Serseriler kralı\nUSA (promotional title): Big Gundown 2: Run, Man, Run\nWest Germany: Lauf um dein Leben\nWorld-wide (English title): Run, Man, Run\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: My Name is Pecos - Spaghetti Western - Everyone wants to know who the Mexican is. He always answer slowly, \"my name is Pecos\".  \n\nMy Name is Pecos (1966)\nDirector: Maurizio Lucidi (as Maurice A. Bright)\nWriters: Adriano Bolzoni (screenplay), Adriano Bolzoni (story)\nStars: Robert Woods, Pier Paolo Capponi, Lucia Modugno \nGenre: Western\nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 23 June 1967 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: My Name is Pecos \nFilming Locations: Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nEveryone wants to know who the Mexican is. He always answer slowly, \"my name is Pecos\". Pecos Martinez ( Robert Woods) to be exact, and he's returned to his hometown of Houston to settle up with Clain(Norman Clarke), the leader of a gang of cut-throats. Clain is busy looking for the money from a recent robbery that's been stolen from him. Soon the stolen cash in Pecos' vengeance entwine and all hell breaks loose. Behind the scenes a Bible touting Undertaker (Umberto Raho), a cowardly saloon owner, & a helpful saloon girl (Christina Iosani) become part of the story. This film made Woods as internationally known as Pecos in the third world countries as Franco Nero was known for Django. A Mexican hero against a gang and a town full of gringos- what more could you ask for?\n\nReviews:\n\"In Fargo we saw an extremely laid-back crook in the car-salesman. The bureaucrat-crook one might say. In this film he has his western counter-part. Never seen this actor in anything else, which is quite unique by its own. Pecos himself is some sort of mexican. They changed his eyes for the role, similarly as they did to Sean Connery for 'You Only Live Twice'. The follow-up to this was quite good as well, but this one is special. Many unique gags and a hero who jumps up on his horse from the back. Those who hear him say 'My Name is Pecos' in the beginning of the film are already dead, when trying to shoot him in the back. Some gags were stolen from this film for 'Trinity', who was a much less interesting hero. A 10 out of 10.\" Written by karlericsson on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Great little flick that unveils a revenge of a slaughtered family and justice being served by a family member. My name is Pecos to me was a gritty film that had a great variety of musical scores in it by Lallo Gori. The camera work was done well by both Giuseppe Ruzzolini and Armando Nannuzzi. Great acting by Robert Woods (Pecos Martinez) and the creepy Morton character who can read the future and make predictions through a deck of poker cards lol.. The opening scene started off great of Pecos walking to Houston no gun carrying a saddle and slowly dying of thirst making us wonder how this could be. He comes up to a sinister looking man in all black who gives him water and a gun only to be killed and after hes been killed the drifter reveals his name Pecos. The two problems, I had with the movie was one the girl who played Nina amazing body but a butterface terrible shame. The second was a weak rushed back story of Joe Kline the lead bad guy killed Pecos Martinez's family as he stated three years ago but when, he looked at him it didn't dawn who the \"Mexican\" was until he finds out late in the movie who he is then it hits him duh. Three years is not a long time ago! Other then this the movie was fun and great music worth watching and enjoying!\" Written by tcaramela on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): 2 once di piombo\nBrazil: Meu Nome é Pecos\nDenmark: Mit navn er Pecos\nFinland: Nimeni on Pecos\nFrance: Mon nom est Pécos\nGreece (transliterated title): Pecos, o tromokratis\nJapan (Japanese title): 復讐の用心棒\nMexico: Mi nombre es Pecos\nNetherlands: Mijn Naam is Pecos\nNorway: My Name is Pecos\nSweden: Mitt namn är Pecos\nSweden: Jagad för dollar\nUSA (video box title): My Name is Pecos\nWest Germany: Jonny Madoc\nWest Germany (video title): American Bull\nYugoslavia (Serbian title): Obracun Pekosa\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Blood for a Silver Dollar - After the Civil War, ex-Confederate officer returns home where he gets embroiled in local feuds involving an unscrupulous strongman and his hired henchmen. \n\nBlood for a Silver Dollar (1965)\nDirector: Giorgio Ferroni (as Calvin Jackson Padget)\nWriters: Giorgio Stegani (story) (as George Finley), Giorgio Stegani (screenplay) (as George Finley) \nStars: Giuliano Gemma, Evelyn Stewart, Pierre Cressoy \nGenres: Action, Romance, Western \nCountry: Italy, France\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 8 August 1965 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: One Silver Dollar \nFilming Locations: Elios Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy \n\nStoryline:\nGiuliano Gemma plays a confederate soldier who returns from the war to fight one at home. Unbeknownst to him, his brother has become the infamous gunfighter \"Black Jack\" to defeat the local bullies. Gemma agrees to ambush and kill Black Jack, only to discover too late who the outlaw really is. With vengeance in his heart he turns on his employers, who then shoot him.\n\nReviews:\n\"Confederate soldier Gary O'Hara (Guiliano Gemma) and his brother Phil are released from a prisoner of war camp following the end of the civil war, the barrels of their guns removed by their captors. Gary returns home to his wife Judy (Evelyn Stewart) whilst Phil is not ready to live such a quiet life and heads off west.\n\nGary soon decides to follow his brother to the town of Yellowstone, and to find work to support his family. On arrival, his combat prowess is soon put to practice, which brings him to the attention of local banker McCory (Pierre Cressoy). McCory offers him a ranch and money if he can kill local outlaw Blacky, which he agrees to do. Gary is taken to the local saloon and advised that Blacky is the man at the bar with his back to him. On confrontation, Blacky turns around, firing his gun - and revealing himself to be Phil O'Hara. McCory and his men open fire, leaving both brothers dead.\n\nThe story itself has a few clichés (for one thing, a fair few screen characters have been saved over the years by an inanimate object conveniently placed on their person) but does that really matter? Clearly not. And there are some great scenes, particularly both the opening (great gun-play as the brothers are released) and final sequence. From a personal perspective, I was also intrigued to note a great visual likeness between Evelyn Stewart and my own girlfriend!!! Not that that should be of any real relevance to this write up.\n\nIn summary, this is one of those nice easy to watch movies (legs up on the sofa, with a wine or beer for company), and certainly worth a few silver dollars of anyones money.\" Written by marc-366 on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Un dollaro bucato\nArgentina: Un dólar marcado\nAustria: Ein Loch im Dollar\nBelgium (French title): Le dollar troué\nBelgium (Flemish title): De reddende dollar\nBrazil: O Dólar Furado\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title): Един пробит долар\nBulgaria (Bulgarian title) (transliterated title): Edin probit dolar\nCanada (English title): Blood for a Silver Dollar\nChile: El dólar marcado\nCzechoslovakia (Czech title): Jeden stříbrný dolar\nDenmark: Mellem vestens banditter\nFinland: Dollari hengestä\nFrance: Le dollar troué\nGreece: 'Ενα τρύπιο δολλάριο\nGreece (transliterated title): Ena trypio dollario\nHungary: Egy lyukas dollár\nIreland (English title): One Silver Dollar\nItaly: Un dollaro bucato\nJapan: Kôya no 1 doru ginka\nJapan (Japanese title): 荒野の1ドル銀貨\nMexico: Un dólar marcado\nPoland: Jeden srebrny dolar\nPortugal: Um Dólar Furado\nRomania: Un dolar găurit\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Прострелянный доллар\nSpain: Un dólar agujereado\nSweden: Den genomskjutna dollarn\nTurkey (Turkish title): Yılmayan aslan\nUK: Blood for a Silver Dollar\nUSA: Blood for a Silver Dollar\nWest Germany: Ein Loch im Dollar\nYugoslavia (Serbian title) (literal title): Probuseni dolar\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Description": "Free Western Movie: Man Who Cried for Revenge - Spaghetti Western - A Civil War veteran is amnesic after being shot in the head. When he rerurns to his hometown, he finds out that he has been declared a deserter.\n\nMan Who Cried for Revenge (1968)\nDirector: Mario Caiano (as William Hawkins)\nWriters: Mario Caiano, Tito Carpi\nStars: Anthony Steffen, William Berger, Robert Hundar\nGenre: Western \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 19 June 1970 (West Germany) \nAlso Known As: A Name That Cried Revenge \n\nStoryline:\nAnthony Steffan is Davy Flanagan, a former Union officer who was part of an attempt to break out of a Confederate prison camp during the Civil War and suffered a blow to the head that left him with amnesia.\n\nThen a bounty hunter shows up to collect a bounty on his head as a deserter. Davy manages another escape.\n\nIn the process, he discovers that the secret to his past might be found in the town of Dixon.\n\nOnce there, he’s scorned by townsfolk who have also heard of his desertion. In fact, rumor has it he deserted the Union army and became commander of a Rebel prisoner of war camp.\n\nBut he finds one man who professes to be his friend: Sam Kellogg (William Berger).\n\nOf course, Kellogg also spirits Clay Hackett (Claudio Undari) out of town quickly because he’s living with Davy’s wife Lisa (Ida Galli). And he lures Davy into a trap that could lead to the gallows.\n\nAh, but Davy escapes yet again. Next stop: Goldfield, a town ruled by bandit Crazy Joe and his men. And this time, he’s taking Sam Kellogg along for the ride. Written by Mark Franklin on http://onceuponatimeinawestern.com\n\nReviews:\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Anthony Steffen, William Berger, Mario Brega: Steffen plays a Union officer (Davy Flanagan) who was shot by a POW camp commander (later revealed to by William Berger) who pretends to be his friend, Sam Kellogg. Due to this head wound, Davy lost all memory of his past. Davy discovers that he is considered a deserter and has a high bounty ($10,000!) on his head. While seeking his beautiful wife, Liza, (Ida Galli aka Evelyn Stewart) who had since become the common law wife to Clay Hackett (Claudio Undari aka Robert Hundar). Liza spends most of her days drinking bottles of liquor and passing out.\n\nDragging Kellogg around, Davy fights off bandit gangs (one led by \"Jack\", Raf Baldarassarre) and kills them all. Dirty (Mario Brega) is a bandit leader want-to-be, who gets dispatched as well. In the final showdown with Hackett's gang and Kellogg, Davy destroys them all with nitro and flying bullets. After Kellogg hits Davy in the head, his memories return, and Kellogg is shot dead and falls into a horse trough. At the end, Liza and Davy are reunited hand in hand.\n\nAlthough Kellogg says that he has an account to settle with Davy, there is no sense in that motive. How would a man who shot an enemy soldier and then masqueraded as a Union soldier by wearing his uniform, have such a hate agenda for man that never did anything to him? Obviously, this paper thin motivational character trope turns up all the time in SW's. Overall, the amnesia plot with Steffen works well here, and we can enjoy plenty of action and a rare romantic happy ending.\" Written by marthahunter on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Il suo nome gridava vendetta\nBrazil: O Seu Nome Clamava Vingança\nDenmark: Med fingeren på aftrækkeren\nFinland: Verikostaja\nFrance: Son nom crie vengeance\nGreece (transliterated title): I ekdikisis mou einai keravnos\nPortugal: O Vingador\nSpain: Su nombre gritaba venganza\nSweden: Blodshämnaren\nSweden: Drick ur whiskyn - lämna stan!\nTurkey (Turkish title): İntikam derler adıma\nUSA: Man Who Cried for Revenge\nWest Germany: Django spricht das Nachtgebet\nWest Germany (video title): Django - Sprich dein Nachtgebet\n A Name That Cried Revenge\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

You can also see a few other stuntman who have played in the most of Fidanis western like Benito Pacifico, Dino Strano, Luciano Conti his daughter Simonetta and you can also see the master himself with incredible big glasses.

        "Description": "Requiescant - The adopted son of a preacher comes upon a village that is under the thumb of a deranged ex-Confederate officer, who is - among other things - stealing land from the locals with phony land grants. \n\nRequiescant (1967)\nDirector: Carlo Lizzani\nWriters: Renato Izzo (story), Franco Bucceri (story)\nStars: Lou Castel, Mark Damon, Pier Paolo Pasolini \nCountry: Italy, Monaco, West Germany\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 10 March 1967 (Italy)\nAlso Known As: Let Them Rest\nFilming Locations: Italy \n\nStoryline:\nThe adopted son of a preacher comes upon a village that is under the thumb of a deranged ex-Confederate officer, who is - among other things - stealing land from the locals with phony land grants.\n\nReviews: \n\"But Spaghetti Westerns were made by left wing radicals, this one actually has one of the leading lights of the PCI (Italian Communist Party) in it, and that is very much the focus for director Carlo Lizzani. Whereas most all of the sub-genre were Westerns with an Italian artistic slant and some radical sub-text, this one is a straight-ahead, let's give the young communistas some proper learning, Western movie style. The story is thin because it's totally unimportant. There aren't plot holes; there's a bit of hand waving to acknowledge it, much like you might add a box to a flow diagram to represent an input you're not fully diagramming. Those bits are deemed unimportant. \"How does he learn to shoot?\" It's not important. It's not telling a story, it's acting out critical moments in life to provoke thoughts about class struggle.\n\nI couldn't believe how dense the political/social message was. EVERY little scene, EVERYTHING is there for symbolic value. And the story isn't that bad as I never felt it dragging. So preachy, such a thin story, it should have become tedious. It never did. I usually watch the classics in installments to get every detail, but I watched this one start to end because I couldn't stop watching it. I couldn't believe he had made such a pure vehicle for talking about class struggle, the role of violence, when should violence be used, how does doing so change the person, etc., etc., etc.\n\nYou can certainly argue that that's not a valid way to make any kind of Western. But if you like Spaghetti Westerns for that reason, this is not to be missed because you will never find another that is so straight-ahead about what it's doing. Lizzani basically said, \"Damn it, I'm tired of p*ssy footing around with a few abstract comparisons. Let's lay it all right out there\". Most the other reviews on this are like reading Alice in Wonderland and saying, \"That doesn't seem very realistic. How can that be about logic?\" But I'm not complaining. It was very nice to be so pleasantly surprised after having very low expectations.\" Written by adrianswingler on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Requiescant\nAustria: Mögen sie in Frieden ruhen\nBrazil: Réquiem Para Matar\nColombia: Que en paz descansen\nDenmark: En hævner renser ud\nFrance: Tue et fais ta prière\nGreece (transliterated title): To telos ton paranomon\nHungary: Nyugodjanak békében\nItaly (reissue title): Dio crea gli uomini, Requiescant li uccide\nJapan: Koroshite Inore\nJapan (Japanese title): 殺して祈れ\nPortugal: Os Assassinos também choram\nSoviet Union (Russian title): Покойся с миром\nTurkey (Turkish title): Sev ve öldür\nUK: Requiescant\nUSA (DVD title): Kill and Pray\nUSA: Let Them Rest\nUSA: Requiescant\nWest Germany: Mögen sie in Frieden ruh'n\nYugoslavia (Macedonian title): Pocivaj vo \n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "Sugar Colt | Jack Betts | Full Western Movie",
        "Description": "Sugar Colt - In order to avenge a friend and to fulfill his last wish, Rocco has to find out what happened to an army corps that has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nSugar Colt (1966)\nDirector: Franco Giraldi\nWriters: Sandro Continenza (screenplay), Sandro Continenza (story) \nStars: Jack Betts, Soledad Miranda, Giuliano Raffaelli \nGenres: Comedy, Romance, Western \nCountry: Italy, Spain\nLanguage: English \nFilming Locations: Desierto de Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain\n\nStoryline:\nIn order to avenge a friend and to fulfill his last wish, Rocco has to find out what happened to an army corps that has mysteriously disappeared. He therefore puts on the disguise of a doctor and starts investigating in a somewhat uncomfortable town.\n\nReviews:\n\"  Sugar Colt\" is an excellent movie that belongs in a list of the top 20 Italian westerns for me. Definitely the best role Hunt Powers ever got in Europe and this genre, as he went on to make Django flicks with Fidani, but \"Sugar Colt\" is memorable also for its unusual script about criminal investigators in the wild west, which makes \"Sugar Colt\" a comedy in the first half and a serious brutal western in the second half - which is absolutely making sense because the main character is totally changing when he gives up his disguise as doctor Cooper and becomes the gunman Sugar Colt. Composer Luis E Bacalov (\"Django\") uses two different themes here to illustrate this: the \"Sugar Colt\" leitmotif, and the soldiers' theme with the trumpet. Spanish photographer Alejandro Ulloa who also shot Corbucci's \"Mercenario\" and Castellari's \"Ammazzali tutti e torna solo\" achieves the perfect western look near Almeria, partly at the same locations \"For A Few Dollars More\" was shot at. Together with the skill of director Giraldi (\"Seven Guns for the MacGregors\") and the legendary Soledad Miranda in her best western role, this is a must have for a \"Western all'italiana\" collection even if currently harder to find than many others. I've got an Italian language DVD with French subtitles in well restored picture quality.\" Written by unbrokenmetal on IMDb.com.\n\n\"The main theme to Sugar Colt reminds me of Ennio Morricone's theme for My Name is Nobody made seven or so years later. Luis Bacalov provides the score and Hunt Powers (aka Jack Betts) provides the charisma for this serio-comic quasi-secret-agent spaghetti western with the renowned Sugar Colt (Powers) going undercover to the town of Snake Valley to investigate the disappearance of a regiment of Union sharpshooters at the end of the Civil War. Most of the humor comes from his posing as Dr. Tom Cooper, mild mannered yet accomplished at boxing and fooling the henchmen of the kidnapper. But the film turns more serious once he reveals himself as Sugar Colt, and the recovery of the regiment takes on a tragic air as supporting characters start to drop. Powers is good in this, as he was in most of his starring efforts in Italy; one wonders why he now acts in small parts under his true name Jack Betts. Perhaps, like Nicholetta Machiavelli and some others, fame did not rest lightly on his shoulders...or perhaps he just hated the name Hunt Powers (it does remind one of Dash Riprock) and having had his minutes of fame in Europe, is content being a journeyman actor. Three stars out of four, and fans of Euro-Westerns will like it better than others. Fans of Soledad Miranda will be delighted by her appearance here.\" Written by heybhc on IMDb.com.\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title): Sugar Colt\nBrazil: Sugar Colt\nEast Germany (TV title): Kavallerie in Not\nFinland: Lännen nopein lääkäri\nFrance: Sugar Colt\nGreece: Sugar Colt\nGreece (reissue title): Trinita, to pio grigoro pistoli\nHong Kong (Mandarin title): Gui ma qi xia\nIndia (English title): Sugar Colt\nJapan: Hissatsu no yôjinbô\nJapan (Japanese title): 必殺の用心棒\nNorway: Western-desperados\nSerbia: Sladunjavi kolt\nSpain: Sugar Colt\nTurkey (Turkish title): Şeker Tabanca\nUK: Sugar Colt\nWest Germany: Rocco - Der Mann mit den zwei Gesichtern\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Our black-clad hero soon has a price on his head and must try to proof his innocence with the help of his shabby friend Buddy Ben. Written by Simon Gelten\n\nReviews:\n\"Nothing short of great stuff here with an excellent cast and a well written script punctuated by some great little moments of humor. Garko is better than usual as the eagle-eyed, razor toungued and lightning fast Sartana and has a wealth of great character actors to support him, including the vastly underrated Frank Wolff. The direction is exceptionally stylish, with numerous POV shots and expressionist angles that add loads of atmosphere to what, in lesser hands, could have been a rather average outing. Great stuff, that may not convert the heathens, but will definitely please the spag aficionados\" Written by Junkie-6 on IMDb.com.\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\"Wily top gunslinger Sartana (a typically excellent portrayal by Gianni Gark) gets falsely accused of robbing a bank. Sartana must find the real robbers in order to clear his name. Meanwhile, a bunch of ruthless bounty hunters are eager to bag Sartana in order to collect the hefty prize money placed on his head. Director Giuliano Carnimeo, working from a clever and involving script by Tito Carpi, Enzo Dell'Aquila, and Ernesto Gastaldi, keeps the crafty plot moving along at a constant swift pace, maintains a playfully quirky tone throughout, further spices things up with a nice sense of wickedly amusing sardonic humor, and stages the thrilling shoot-outs with considerable skill and brio (the opening bank robbery set piece is especially daring and exciting). The cast have a field day with their colorful roles: Frank Wolf contributes a lively and engaging performance as Sartana's loyal fellow sharpshooter partner Buddy Ben, the always interesting Klaus Kinski is a sleazy treat as slimy and effeminate luckless gambling addict Hot Dead, and Gordon Mitchell makes a strong impression as the fearsome and lightly crazed Deguejo. Giovanni Bergamini's crisp and agile cinematography boasts a lot of fierce whiplash pans and crazy tilted camera angles. The twangy and dynamic score by Vasili Kojucharov and Elsio Maneuso hits the rousing spot.

        "Description": "Payment in Blood - A gunman joins up with a gang of Confederate guerrillas to find a cache of missing Confederate gold. \n\nPayment in Blood (1967)\nDirector: Enzo G. Castellari (as E.G. Rowland)\nWriters: Tito Carpi (story and screenplay), Enzo G. Castellari (story and screenplay) (as E.G. Rowland)\nStars: Edd Byrnes, Ennio Girolami, Luisa Baratto \nCountry: Italy\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: April 14, 1967 (Italy)\nFilming Locations: Italy \n\nStoryline:\nIt's 1867 Texas. The American Civil War has ended but a handful of Confederate commanders and their units refuse to accept defeat and surrender. One of these commanders is Colonel Thomas Blake. He and his men raid the farms, towns and settlements where Yankees live. Rumors abound about Colonel Blake having gone insane. Many claim that Blake robs and kills for his own pleasure and personal gain rather than in the name of Confederacy. The authorities post huge rewards for the capture or killing of Colonel Blake and his men. However, Blake is shrewd and hard to entrap. He too wants money. More specifically, Colonel Blake is after the 200 thousand dollars that vanished in the final days of the war from the Confederate coffers. The money was last seen in the strong box of Confederate General Beauregard. Blake sends a trusted aide, Chamaco Gonzales, to inquire among the Confederate veterans and disbanded soldiers about the whereabouts of General Beauregard's strong box. But Chamaco is ... Written by nufs68\n\nReviews: \n\"Crazed Confederate raider Guy Madison can't stop raiding, even after the Civil War is over and done with. Ex-Confederate Edd \"Kookie\" Byrnes knows where a fortune in confederate treasure is buried and needs the bloodthirsty Madison and his band of cutthroats to get there, leading to an uneasy alliance and a harrowing trip across the frontier.\n\nAnother of director Enzo G. Castellari's patented brand of light-hearted adventure films, Payment In Blood is a decent enough, if not very original movie. It does have it's share of good action scenes, locations, and performances by it's lead actors, benefiting greatly from Byrnes charisma and Madison's machismo. The climax at the Indian burial ground is pretty neat too.\n\nCastellari is actually pretty good at setting up and directing action sequences. He made his fair share of good movies, but I feel he really could have knocked it out of the park (and still can) if given the right script.\" Written by FightingWesterner on IMDb.com.\n\n\"Enzo G. Castellari was a director who seemed to contribute films in a variety of genres, from sci-fi to giallo. I get the feeling that his best ones are his spaghetti westerns though. In Payment in Blood he delivers a pretty solid entry. Its story features a renegade Confederate colonel who refuses to accept the South's defeat in the American Civil War and so continues the fight with a band of outlaws. A stranger saves one of his gang from execution and is taken into their fold when he reveals that he knows the whereabouts of a casket of buried money.\n\nIt would only be fair to say that the plot-line has quite a few similarities with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Its hero, however, looks a little different from the shady leads from other spaghettis. He looks more like a character from an American traditional western, although he still has the same amorality and essentially acts in a similar way. The villains are decent enough and there is a fair amount of violent action to keep us entertained. Things are wrapped up with an interesting enough climax in an Indian burial ground, located in a cave. Overall, this is an entertaining, if unremarkable, western and should definitely find approval with fans of the Italian strand.\" Written by Red-Barracuda on IMDb.com.\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

When Buffalo Bill goes to Wise Fox, the chief of Yellow Hand's tribe, and tries to convince him to sign a peace treaty with the federal troops, Yellow Fox gets wind of the plan and abducts Wise Fox's daughter, making it look like the soldiers are responsible. His deception succeeds and the Indians attack the army outpost. The only way peace can be restored is by Buffalo Bill defeating Yellow Hand in a climactic, savage, one-on one fight.\n\nReviews:\nMuscleman Gordon Scott swaps his loincloth/tunic for a buckskin fringe jacket, jeans and a six gun in this entertaining euro western. It classed as a spaghetti western, but it eschews the gritty and anti-hero elements of that ilk. This western is a traditional shoot-em up a la John wayne-style with colourful locations, and there's plenty of intense action. Every western lexicon is covered here: barroom brawls, saloon shoot em ups, and exciting staged Indian fort attack. There's a naive charm about it with a lot of colour and energy.\n- written by \"coltras35\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Buffalo Bill, l'eroe del far west\nBuffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West\nL'attaque de Fort Adams\nBrazil O Herói do Oeste\nDenmark Buffalo Bill - helten fra vesten(reissue title)\nDenmark Buffalo Bill, helten fra det vilde vesten\nFinland Voittamaton\nFrance L'attaque de Fort Adams(Video Title)\nFrance Buffalo Bill, le héros du Far-West\nGreece Buffalo Bill, o iroas tou Far West(transliterated title)\nItaly Buffalo Bill, l'eroe del far west\nMexico Buffalo Bill, el héroe del oeste\nNetherlands Buffolo Bill, De Held van het Wilde Westen\nPoland Buffalo Bill\nPortugal Buffalo Bill Herói do Far West\nSpain El héroe del Oeste\nSweden Den blodiga västern\nSweden Västerns hjälte - Buffalo Bill(video box title)\nTurkey Buffalo Bill(Turkish)\nUnited Kingdom Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West\nUnited Kingdom Buffalo Bill l'eroe del far west (subtitle Hero Of The West)(TV Title)\nUnited States Buffalo Bill\nUnited States Buffalo Bill, Hero of the West(DVD Title)\nWest Germany Das war Buffalo Bill\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "Title": "Adiós Gringo | Giuliano Gemma | Classic Western",
        "Description": "Adiós Gringo - A cowboy attempts to clear his name by hunting the rustlers who tricked him into buying stolen cattle, and are also responsible for the rape of a young woman he is helping recuperate.\n\nAdiós Gringo (1965)\nDirector: Giorgio Stegani\nWriters: Giorgio Stegani, Harry Whittington, José Luis Jerez Aloza\nStars: Giuliano Gemma, Ida Galli, Roberto Camardiel\nGenre: Drama, Western\nCountry: Italy, France, Spain\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: December 22, 1965 (Italy)\nFilming Location: Italy\n\nSynopsis:\nA gunslinger on the run for a murder he didn't commit goes to New Mexico where he hopes to find a person who can exculpate him. While on his way he finds a girl who has been kidnapped and tortured, sets her free and then takes his revenge at gunpoint.\n\nReviews:\nBrett Landers, a cowboy, buys cattle from his friend Gil Clawson for his ranch but gets falsely accused of theft. In self-defense, he kills his accuser and faces a lynch mob. Escaping with his gun, Brett vows to return and find the real thief. On his journey, he encounters Lucy, a girl kidnapped and tortured during a stagecoach attack.\n\nDespite helping Lucy, Brett faces suspicion in the nearest town as the real culprits are still at large. Lucy identifies the thieves, including Gil Clawson. One of them, Avery Ranchester, is the son of influential Clayton Ranchester. The trio tries to silence Lucy, kidnapping Brett to stage an escape. Brett escapes, kills one bandit, and flees with Lucy, while Clayton Ranchester turns the crowd against Brett, sparking a mountain manhunt.\n\nAdios Gringo is a thoroughly gripping western that has a hard edge and a certain depth to the characters. There's action but close attention is paid to the plot and characterisation. The pace never falters nor does the challenges for the hero. The hero, of course, is Guiliano Gemma who is a likeable and sympathetic character. His gentleness to the Lucy after her ordeal is touching. The supporting cast includes Nello Pazzafini as the villainous Jack Dawson, Roberto Camardiel as a doctor and Evelyn Stewart as Lucy, all deliver really well. I liked the sheriff - who was a little reluctant to help as he doesn't want to rock the boat and lose his job but finally does the right thing- and the doctor working together to help Brett and Lucy - it was a fun aspect. The finale is a tense showstopper.\n- written by \"coltras35\" on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Adiós gringo\nArgentina Adiós gringo\nBrazil Adeus Gringo\nBulgaria Сбогом, Гринго(Bulgarian)\nCanada Adiós gringo(English)\nChile Adiós gringo\nDenmark Gringo, skyd fra hoften\nFinland Adios gringo\nFrance Adios Gringo\nFrance Adieu Gringo(TV Title)\nGermany Adios Gringo\nGreece Αντιός γκρίνγκο(transliterated title)\nHungary Adios, gringo\nItaly Adiós gringo\nJapan 続さすらいの一匹狼(Japanese)\nPoland Zegnaj, gringo\nPortugal Adeus Gringo\nRomania Adio gringo\nSpain Adiós, gringo\nTaiwan 江湖奇士\nTurkey Gringo vadiler kaplanı(Turkish)\n\n✘ Website: https://www.grjngo.com\n\nFOLLOW US!\n✘ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/grjngo_westernmovies\n✘ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Grjngo_com\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/2V63h4q\n✘ Merchandise - https://bit.ly/2FLB0sV\n\nMORE WESTERN MOVIES! \n► Classics: https://bit.ly/2CBLt8c \n► Spaghetti Western: https://bit.ly/2CyCe8I \n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EOOfIH \n\n#westernmovies #freemovies #spaghettiwesterns\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.
