        "Description": "The people of Kilgarvan in Kerry are the stars of this opening sequence to \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019.\n\nThe village of Kilgarvan (in Irish Cill Gharbh\u00e1in, meaning church of Saint Garbhan) is situated between Killarney and Kenmare in County Kerry.\n\nPeople going about their business are happy to wave to the camera crew, who provide a welcome diversion for children in the national school. A vehicle tyre requires air, and supplies for one of the businesses in the village are being unloaded.\n\nOnce a week, from June to September, the \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019 film crew would arrive at a town or village in any county in Ireland. They would film the people and the place and return to RT\u00c9 where the footage was edited and the theme music added.\n\nThis short film of around one minute\u2019s duration formed part of the opening sequence for that week\u2019s episode. No-one knew which location had been chosen, and it was not advertised as part of the programme billings in the RT\u00c9 Guide or newspapers.\n\nSo with this in mind, people the length and breadth of the country tuned in religiously, in case it was the turn of their town or village to have its few minutes of fame.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019 broadcast on 28 May 1976.\n\nJoin us as we take a nostalgic journey back to this iconic moment in history.

        "Title": "Revisiting Meet The Connolly Hurling Brothers from Castlegar, Co. Galway, Ireland 1982",
        "Description": "Meet the Connolly Brothers from Castlegar who are champion hurlers, Gaeilgeoir\u00ed and hurley makers.\n\nPat and M\u00e1ire Connolly have ten children \u2013 M\u00e1ire, Sarah, John, Padraig, Michael, Philomena, Joe, Gerry, Tom, and Murt. The Connolly children grew up in Castlegar, with strong roots in the Connemara of their parents\u2019 birth, and a deep pride in their country.\n\nJoe, John, Michael and Gerry turned out to be champion hurlers.  The array of trophies in Pat and M\u00e1ire\u2019s living room would not look out of place in a hurling museum and is a testament to their hurling talents and sportsmanship, not only in the All-Ireland, but also in the Railway Cup, and a host of county championships.  As hurlers, it seemed they were unstoppable,\n\nA bhfuil le buach ann san iom\u00e1na\u00edocht, t\u00e1 s\u00e9 buaite acu.\n\nTheir father Pat is particularly proud of their All-Ireland win for Galway in 1980, given that the Galway hurling team languished in the doldrums for so long.\n\nBut how did they grow up bilingual, so close to Galway City?  John Connolly was born in Connemara, but moved with his parents to Castlegar at the age of five. Despite being surrounded by English speakers, the children never lost their Irish, as their mother and father insisted that they speak it at home,\n\n...Gaeilge teanga an t\u00ed i gc\u00f3na\u00ed.\n\nThe language and the Connemara traditions that their parents kept alive enabled them to keep a foot in two camps so that they felt equally at home when in Connemara as in Galway city. \n\nSuch is the high regard that people have for this band of brothers, that Taoiseach Charles Haughey was present at the official opening of their joinery factory, in Laghtgeorge, County Galway. \n\nThe relationship between a player and their hurley is a personal one, and something which develops as the skill of the hurler develops.  While Joe Connolly can see the benefits of plastic hurleys, especially for children, when it comes to playing in a match, the real thing is required.\n\nJoe takes reporter Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 hEithir through the hurley making process. The starting point of every hurley\u2019s journey is the raw wood, ash, which is carefully selected, and carved into planks. These are then placed in a special machine where they are planed down before being finished by hand. The entire process takes time and skill before the finished product emerges,\n\nT\u00e1 s\u00e9 cine\u00e1l c\u00e9im ar ch\u00e9im, like, agus tagann an cruth an cham\u00e1n air.\n\n \nThis episode of \u2018F\u00e9ach\u2019 was broadcast on 7 May 1982. The reporter is Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 hEithir\n\n\u2018F\u00e9ach\u2019 was an Irish language current affairs programme which went out on RT\u00c9 Television from 1967 to 1985.  Presenters and reporters were Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 hEithir, Prionsias Mac Aonghusa, Andy O\u2019Mahony, Doireann N\u00ed Bhriain,  Eamonn \u00d3 Muir\u00ed, M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 hUanach\u00e1in and Poil\u00edn N\u00ed Chiar\u00e1in.\n\nJoin us as we take a nostalgic journey back to this iconic moment in history.

        "Description": "Taking a flight on Concorde, Mike Murphy is well fed and gets some golf practice all while travelling at twice the speed of sound.\n\nThe RAF airfield at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire is the training base for Concorde pilots. Mike Murphy meets Chief Training Officer Captain Norman Todd, who was the pilot of Concorde\u2019s inaugural flight to Washington, and watches as a Concorde plane lands at approximately 170 mph. \n\nTraining pilots to fly Concorde doesn\u2019t come cheap. The cost of each training flight comes in at over \u00a310,000.\n\nOn a 90-minute training flight Concorde uses up 23 tonnes of fuel.\n\nPilot Kitt says of flying Concorde.\n\nIt\u2019s a very smooth, very precise aircraft.\n\nFlying by Concorde is no ordinary affair. In the departure lounge, Mike Murphy is presented with a glass of champagne. On board, he is again indulged with more champagne, describing it as,\n\nUndoubtedly, the toughest assignment I\u2019ve been on.\n\nDescribing his first impressions on board Concorde, Mike Murphy says it is a little disappointing. While there is more leg room and top-notch service, the windows are smaller.\n\nOriginally the designers didn\u2019t want to include windows at all.\n\nA return fair from Dublin to Bahrain of \u00a3776 with a flight time of four hours and ten minutes, as opposed to six hours and twenty minutes on a sub-sonic flight. \n\nThe silver service catering on board is second to none. The lunch menu includes smoke salmon and foie gras canapes, chilled caviar from Iran, sirloin steak, Marchand du Vin, breast of duckling, and fillets of sole, which Mike Murphy describes as just like the food available in the RT\u00c9 canteen. \n\nDuring the flight at a speed of 670 mph, the captain makes a special announcement welcoming RT\u00c9 and Mike Murphy on board. \n\nI\u2019d like to welcome on board the Irish television company.\n\n He is surprised on a visit to the cockpit during the flight and how small and cramped it is. \n\nWe\u2019re right in the very front of a very sharp aircraft.\n\nNow travelling at twice the speed of sound, at about 23 miles per minute. \n\nWe\u2019re travelling faster than the speed of a rifle bullet. It\u2019s quite mind-boggling.\n\nPutting a golf ball on board Concorde while travelling at twice the speed of sound Mike Muprhy calculates that the ball travelled the equivalent of two miles in the four seconds it took to take the putt. \n\nThis episode of \u2018The Likes of Mike\u2019 was broadcast on 8 March 1977.

        "Title": "Revisiting Should the Market Cross in Kells, Co. Meath be moved? Ireland 1967",
        "Description": "Should the Market Cross in Kells in County Meath be moved from its present position?\n\nKells in County Meath has five crosses, the earliest from around the 8th century, the latest from the 10th or 11th century. Four of the crosses are in or near the graveyard of Saint Columbas Church, Kells. The fifth, a sandstone high cross known as the Market Cross, stands at the heart of the town in the centre of a complex road system.\n\nNo one can say for certain that it always stood here.\n\nIt is generally accepted the cross has been moved on a number of occasions. It has been at its present position at the junction of Market Street, Castle Street and John\u2019s Street since 1688.\n\nThe Kells Tidy Town committee is advocating for the removal of Market Cross to a less prominent position. Patrick Skelly would like to see the cross moved and points to three reasons for this viewpoint. The main one is because the cross is a traffic hazard. He is worried the cross could be damaged which he believes will reflect badly on the Kells Tidy Town committee. He also points out the cross is not in its original position as it is facing north to south,\n\nAll those crosses when they were first erected were erected east to west.\n\nTo preserve the monument and facilitate the study of its sculpture, he would like to see the cross moved to the grounds of Saint Colmcille\u2019s Church, Kells.\n\nThe people of Kells have differing views regarding the location of the cross. Some believe the cross is creating traffic problems. Others think its removal would make traffic worse. Many want the cross to be left alone. One man thinks,\n\nThe cross would lose its identity if it were shifted elsewhere.\n\nPatrick Skelly is adamant the cross should be moved and would like to see the county council take responsibility for the relocation.\n\n\u2018Newsbeat\u2019 was a half-hour feature programme presented by Frank Hall and ran for seven years from September 1964 to June 1971. \u2018Newsbeat\u2019 went out from Monday to Friday on RT\u00c9 television and reported on current affairs and issues of local interest from around Ireland.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Newsbeat\u2019 was broadcast on 7 March 1967.

        "Description": "A profile of the Labour Party Chairman Michael D Higgins.\n\nMichael D Higgins, a University College Galway (UCG) lecturer and former Senator succeeds Roddy Connolly as Chairman of the Labour Party. \n\nThe post of party chairman certainly carries prestige and status but it\u2019s a position that pales beside the acquisition of those elusive that Higgins has sought after for almost ten years now, TD.\n\nComing from rural County Clare, Michael D Higgins came to Galway in 1960 as a clerk in the ESB. Two years later, he enrolled in UCG and excelled in his college career that brought him to the world of academia, now a lecturer in Sociology. \n\nMichael D Higgins recalls his feelings of isolation growing up in rural Clare with his aunt and uncle. \n\nHis involvement in party politics began with a brief term as chairman of UCG Fianna F\u00e1il. He first ran as a Labour candidate in Galway West in 1969 gaining 1,100 votes and in 1973 he amassed over 5,000 votes. As the years passed his politics moved more to the left and he now feels that the next election must be make or break for him. He is opposed to coalitions and believes that the Labour Party has suffered by its involvement in government with Fine Gael.\n\nAs it had to cut back its socialist programme, it has lost membership. It lost, I think, a certain amount of credibility.\n\nMichael D Higgins believes that for the Labour Party to be successful it must show a commitment to unambiguous and practical policies. He points out that the appeal of socialism is in its rationality. \n\nThe nature of coalitions is that one loses one\u2019s programme.\n\nHiggins believes that the Labour Party should have a single minded radical course with clear and practical policies around jobs, housing, health, environment and culture.\n\nThe Labour Party recently opened a centre overlooking Eyre Square in Galway, partly in an effort to garner support so that Higgins will secure a D\u00e1il seat.\n\nIf anyone is to get a seat for Labour west of the Shannon, it would be Michael D\n\nThis episode of \u2018PM\u2019 was broadcast on 2 May 1978.

        "Description": "Young people take an Irish course with a difference with Eachtra in the Falcarragh Gaeltacht in Donegal.\n\nIn 1970 Gael Linn established Eachtra, adventure courses for Irish speaking teenagers. The scheme does not teach Irish, but instead provides instruction for adventure sports such as kayaking, sailing, orienteering and rock climbing through the Irish language.\n\nMost of the Eachtra courses take place in the Gaeltacht. The RT\u00c9 young people\u2019s programme, \u2018Off The Wall\u2019 visits Falcarragh in Donegal to film a group of young people undertaking some Eachtra activities in the region. The teenagers on the course are from all parts of Ireland and are ready for the mountains, sea and craic.\n\nThe Eachtra group are out in the wilds of Donegal where they plan to follow a trail past Aghla More to Aghla Beg. On this hike, they will experience great views of Errigal and other mountains in the area. There is no need to worry about bus strikes or traffic jams in this idyll.\n\nSuaimhneas agus and s\u00edoch\u00e1in.\n\nThe poor weather does not bother the intrepid hikers. They reach Loch Altan a lake situated at the foot of the northern slopes of Errigal. One of the group says the place lives up to her expectations. At their journey\u2019s end the students have views of Errigal, Muckish and in the distance, the sea. The group then try canoeing on a river in Dunlewey.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Off The Wall\u2019 was broadcast on 27 July 1981.\n\nJoin us as we take a nostalgic journey back to this iconic moment in history.

        "Description": "The people and village of Athleague are the stars of this opening sequence for \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019.\n\nThe village of Athleague (\u00c1th Liag as Gaeilge, meaning \u2018stony ford\u2019 ) is located on the River Suck, approximately ten kilometres outside Roscommon town.\n\nWhen \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019 production crew visit Athleague farmers are going about their business, children are on their way home from school, and one lady has just posted a letter.\n\nThis episode of \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019 was broadcast on 15 March 1978.\n\nOnce a week, from June to September, the \u2018Hall\u2019s Pictorial Weekly\u2019 film crew would arrive at a town or village in any county in Ireland. They would film the people and the place and return to RT\u00c9 where the footage was edited and put to music.\n\nThis short film of around one minute\u2019s duration formed part of the opening sequence for that week\u2019s episode. But no-one knew which location had been chosen, and it was not advertised as part of the programme billings in the RT\u00c9 Guide or newspapers.\n\nSo with this in mind people the length and breadth of the country tuned in religiously, in case it was the turn of their town or village to have its few minutes of fame.\n\nJoin us as we take a nostalgic journey back to this iconic moment in history.
